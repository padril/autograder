    "\n",
    "* Week 1: reading in corpora; basic text processing; querying\n",
    "* Week 2: advanced text processing (SpaCy); outputting queries\n",

    "### reading in CSVs\n",
    "\n",
    "CSVs are the simplest form in which spreadsheets are stored. If you have created a spreadsheet in Excel or another spreadsheet editor, you can save it as a CSV (you'll lose some of the lay-out, like highlighting and font effects like boldface and underlining), and read it in to Python. (You _can_ read in Excel files (.xlsx) directly too, as we will see when we discuss Pandas, but for larger corpora, it's often still useful to know how you can read such files in through the CSV library).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV library allows you to read out spreadsheets with headers as lists of dictionaries, which makes for easy processing. Suppose you have a spreadsheet that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| sentence    | speaker     | text       |\n",
    "| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |\n",
    "| 1           | Vladimir    | Nothing to be done |\n",
    "| 2           | Estragon    | I'm beginning to come round to that opinion ... So there you are again. | \n",
    "| 3           | Vladimir    | Am I? |\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the `DictReader()` function on the filehandle of the file containing this spreadsheet will allow you to iterate over the three lines, with each line being transformed into a dictionary, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {'sentence' : '1', 'speaker' : 'Vladimir', 'text' : 'Nothing to be done' } ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a fragment of the DoReCo corpus (https://doreco.huma-num.fr/), a collection of fieldwork data for 51 languages, often glossed. Here, we're looking at Nǁng, a moribund Tuu language spoken in the very south of Africa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C7%81ng_language).\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful first thing to do with files is to see what they look like as texts. The code below does that, by iterating over the newline-separated lines in the file and printing them."

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \\\"I guess it would be fine\\\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \\\"couldn't be bothered\\\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \\n\\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \\\"last nights waiter\\\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \\nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.\", \"date\": \"2015-03-05 03:37:54\"}\n",

      ">>> 4.0 The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \n",
      "I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 To the other reviewers \n",
      "You are reviewing the god damn stadium, not that your a Philly fan, and OMG your team won the world series in 08. \n",
      "\n",
      "-The food sucks, they do not have enough vendors, So if your enjoying the game, you pretty much have to get up to buy yourself a pretzel or soda. \n",
      "-Point out the worst food, the \"Hoagies\" or whatever are Terrible. Aren't they suppose to be like really good (Believe I'm in Philly). The french fries are mad greasy and no crunch or anything. They were soggy, greasy fries!!!! \n",
      "- They have cheap small TVs, that are blurry as hell, so there goes the idea of watching the game while your on line waiting for your food. \n",
      "- I would love to understand how the game has just started (3rd inning), and I find empty beer containers everywhere.. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is not part of my judgement, but for other people to be aware and be careful \n",
      "Philly fans are the RUDEST and NASTIEST people. They are very drunk people, they get in your face, they will spill things on you. Even if your a girl, they have no respect. \n",
      "\n",
      "This stadium SUCKS, visit it, knock it off your list, see cheap home runs, since the stadium is built for hitters... \n",
      "but we advised...Bring your own food and beware of Philly fans. \n",
      "PS: There still are nasty even if you aren't a mets fan...they are just rude people. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 At first I thought the prices here were pretty decent, but then I realized that they charge for every add on- chips/salsa, rice and beans, etc. I would be fine with this if the food was exceptional, but it is subpar. Both times I've been here, my side order of rice has been hard and dry, and burritos sad and limp. Additionally, the waitress we've had the two times going there had a horrible attitude. The only thing that saves this place is the guac, and the strong margaritas. Their strategy must be to get people drunk enough to not care about what they're eating and the rude service. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 4.0 Allegro's is great. The pizza is really cheap, and lightning fast. My favorite was the sicilian, followed by the, uh, meaty kind, followed in a close third by anything stuffed (sometimes the centers were cold). They also sell beer, but I can't comment much on that because when I lived in Philadelphia I was under 21.\n",
      "The only downside is the service (occasionally rude) and the constant crazies that hang out there talking to themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 Worst nail salon experience ever. The guy said \"what is wrong with you\" to a customer who accidentally chipped her nail. When I was explaining how I wanted my nails filed he told me to do it myself. Really bad job. Everyone was rude and does the job too quickly. You would think after having such bad reviews they would learn.. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 crappy restarurant with awful service and rude waiter. if you are looking for a GOOD BYO italian restaurant, go to La Baia on 17th and Lombard! \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 I tried to like this place... I really did. So much so that I went back to try it after a less that satisfactory first wax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  \n",
      "I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much? \n",
      "\n",
      "The hunt for a decent Brazilian wax in Philly continues- someone help me PLEASE! \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE! I would literally give this place 0 stars if I could. I've never felt the urge to write a review before but I'm just so dumbfounded with how I was treated this evening. The bouncer was the rudest person I've ever met. I was very patient and polite with him when it was my turn and I smiled at him when he shined the light on me and that's when he asked me for another form of ID. This was foreign to me because I've literally never had anyone question my PASSPORT ID! I told him no and he made me leave (grabbed me when I tried to get my friends attention to tell her they wouldn't let me in). So I'm already annoyed and I kind of made a scene but I went all the way to my car to grab my license (which doesn't have my picture cause I'm from WA and I renewed via mail) and my debit card which has my picture on it as well. I wait in the long line again only for him to tell me \"I don't believe these are you\" without even looking at my 2 new forms of ID. He didn't even try to ask me any specific questions to see if it's me (ID #, weight, etc) he just singled me out of my group of 15+ people like an as*hole. I was literally so confused at this man trying to tell me that multiple pictures of me are not me... Needless to say, I'm going to make a phone call or two tomorrow because this is unacceptable and very unprofessional and should not be tolerated. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 Perfect place to go  if you like waiting 20 minutes at the counter and getting dirty looks from the waiters while you're waiting for service. My friend and I made the mistake of coming here after being famished after a long day. Hey Johnny Rockets, I understand that you guys can get busy, but a quick acknowledgment that we existed would have sufficed. After finally waving down a waitress, we finally got a menu with a heavy sigh on the side as if we were troubling the staff. I urged my friend that we should probably leave, but we had already waited long enough, so I reluctantly ordered.\n",
      "I got the original burger and fries as did my friend as per usual. Don't get me wrong, the burgers and fries are decent but definitely not worth the wait or hassle. Even the chocolate shake that I ordered was pretty good with a good consistency, but the taste of bad service still lingered and eventually overpowered the chocolate flavored concoction. Needless to say, I will definitely not be coming back to this location if it continues to be managed so rudely. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 4.0 I stayed at the Hotel Monaco on a recent visit to Philadelphia and I was impressed with almost everything. Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It's a new hotel, so I'm sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 I lived in Lincoln Green Apartments from September 2003 until June 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I changed my apartment within the Lincoln Green as the water from the yard had destroyed the wall. The wall was wet for 3-4 month and the management failed fix it regardless of multiple inquiries. Finally they offered me to move to another apartment and did not compensate for the time and moving expenses. They did not even decrease the rate of the new apartment at least to the rate that I had been paying for the old one. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. My expensive bicycle was stolen from the second floor balcony. All my attempts to ask for reasonable increased security in the community was useless. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. When my rent was over, I washed the carpets and had one of the office employees come to inspect the apartment and sign off on my lease termination. I had about 100 Dollars security deposit that I never received back and because of my busy schedule, I did not really care to follow. However, a few years after, I noticed a \"Collection Notice\" on my credit report. As I investigated that, I realized that the Lincoln Green Apartment had reported me to Collection Agency for what they said \"  150 Dollars fee for not washing the carpet\". They had never contacted me although they had my new address, email, and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars. When I contacted them, I faced bunch of rude people with no respect, what so ever, to a customer. As soon as they realized that I am not looking for rent, they hung up the phone on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. If you walk (not jump) in your apartment or watch TV after 9 pm, don't be surprised to get a knock on the door by your neighbors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two of my friends who also lived in Lincoln Green Apartments had similar experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly discourage renting the Lincoln Green Apartments for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Disrespectful and rude employees and managers\n",
      "2. Their abuse of having the SSN of the tenants.\n",

      ">>> 3.0 Booked a 1 King Bed Executive on the 24th floor and the view of the city from that high above was amazing. However, I had a couple of problems with the professionalism of the staff which is why I rated three stars instead of five. I can't help but make this personal and say that I wasn't treated with equal warmness and courtesy because of my appearance. Coming from a red eye flight, I arrived at the hotel with sweatpants and frazzled hair. I do have tattoos and I'm in my early twenties so I felt like the staff regarded me as not as significant as the other guests. I had a couple of rude stares initially and when I visited the executive lounge (which requires a key) for some breakfast I received an almost, \"Who let you in?\" look from the woman serving breakfast. With that said, the room service operator seemed quite irritated whenever she took my orders but the actual room service deliverers were quite friendly, so I made sure to tip them well. Food and beverage could do some work, it's the not the worst but definitely not the best, especially for the price. I had free wi-fi with my stay, so that was very nice and convenient. Overall, I would stay again at the DoubleTree in Center City just because my stay wasn't awful but the staff definitely needs to brush up on their services techniques and courtesies. Just because someone is young and underdressed and has tattoos does not make them less worthy of respect. My money is as good as anyone else's. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 It was first time visiting. and I didn't know what or how should I order my burger. but the cashier  didn't help me at all. She was so unkind and rude. I will never come back here again!! \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 Please do not bring your loved one to this hospital, they use their patients as guinea pigs and staff have little regard for the privacy and dignity of patients even if they require critical care! My auntie is struggling to stay alive and when my mom stayed with her just two days ago mom had to stand in the room with her the entire time because there were no chairs. When she asked the nurse for a chair the nurse rudely responded that they couldn't accomodate everyone in the hospital. We are looking into transferring my auntie out of this terrible place. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 How has this place survived???? In Germantown no less?!?!?!? The old guy behind the counter (I'm assuming he's the proprietor) was unwelcoming, surly, and kinda rude. I only ordered a cheesesteak with fried onions...admittedly without looking at the menu..and when he told me it was $8.90, I thought I jumped into a wormhole and was in South Philly at Pat's or Geno's. Let me just jump to my summation...it wasn't worth $8.90. Did they pass a new cheesesteak tax too??? It's all good and lesson learned. I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards. Hell..they even charge more for SPENDING more. Who does that???? \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 Not a great vibe, employees were pretty rude minus the bartender, and all in all probably will never go back. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 3.0 This is 3 miles away from the main drag of State Street (taxi costs approx $15 to get into 'town').  Rooms are a decent size and the front desk staff were very pleasant.  Coffee, fruit, cookies and water free in the  room.  And the Cal KIng mattress was the most amazing mattress I've ever slept on to be quite frank.\n",
      "We had one unfortunate incident at the restaurant attached to the hotel - 4 of us went to breakfast there this morning. We're English by birth but we've lived in Los Angeles for many years.  However, the restaurant staff heard our English accents and decided that they could take us for a ride with the tip.  When presenting us with the check, they added a 20% tip to the final total.  We immediately addressed it with the manager - firstly, a check should never be presented with gratuity added unless it's a party of 6 or more.  Secondly, automatically adding 20% is just rude.  Fact of the matter is, we probably would have tipped 20%.  The managers response was weak.  He informed us that many \"Europeans\" don't know the tipping ettiquette and therefore, they decided to assist us by 'adding 20%\" to the check.  His manner and demeanor was completely offensive. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against, disrespected, and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However, they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next, two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter, a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view.

There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude.

      ">>> 1.0 Just got home from my LONG drive to Philadelphia PA. I had a house full of guests  and the general consensus for dinner was island cuisine. Unfortunately, I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space, I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy, vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter, thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately, I and a few other customers (or should I say \"potential customers\" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately, they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!!\n",

There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**.

When there was finally a place the waitress was really rude and said we couldn't sit because we had already ordered food and we were already eating. Hello?

She ripped very large areas of hair, was rude, and left me bleeding and bruised.  Yes, I was bruised from the wax!!  I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this was just awful. I immediately got dressed after the service and went outside to pay.  I was shaking from the shock of the whole thing.   As I go to pay, I complain to the receptionist, who only took $5 off my service!  She wouldn't budge with her price and tried to make up excuses as to why it would hurt so much.

The \"technician\" was an older woman, which is fine but she was very rude, unfriendly, sharp, and rough when grabbing my hand. She attempted to paint my nails, but it was pretty awful. It was a quick and sloppy job that she wanted to charge me $10 for. I asked to speak to the manager, just to see if I would get a discount or what, cause I really did not want that lady to re-do her poor job as she was very rude. The manager refused to speak to me face to face, but I could see her in the back. The woman who did my nails became upset very quickly and attempted to grab my hand and force me to let her re-do her first job. It was SO unprofessional, and at this point everyone in the salon was looking at this situation. I just wanted to leave and gave them the money. I have NEVER felt so mistreated at a business, and felt that the manager should have made more of an effort to make sure the customer left somewhat satisfied. I WOULD NOT recommend visiting this salon. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 I really wanted to be able to leave a good review, this place is within walking distance so the location is super convenient.  Basically, the food is mediocre, which is fine, I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, \"oh.\"  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers. This place has potential, but until they realize that service is an equally important part of the restaurant experience, they probably won't even try to improve. Such a bummer. \n",

On my most recent visit (July 8, 2012) I picked up a bouquet of yellow and white daisies and as of this posting (a week later) they are still just as vibrant and full of life as they were the day I bought them.

She brought our menus over and just put them on the table, rolled her eyes and walked away. No smile, nothing. What a horrible start of our meal.

I then bought a student package for $141 (buy 3 waxes, get 1 \"free\"). With the package each wax comes out to about $35. I paid for my services and left. After walking down the block, I looked at my receipt and saw that it was under another woman's name (Jessica). Essentially, instead of adding the package under my name, the receptionist had added it under the name of the woman who had paid right before me.

I told her that this was her mistake, and I would like it sorted out regardless of how busy they were. There was also another woman sitting at the front desk to help with other guests. I said I wasn't comfortable leaving with a receipt that was issued under someone else's name and no proof of payment for packages under my name. Jhana was visibly frustrated by my persistence and didn't seem to care to resolve the issue at all  - even though it was the result of her carelessness. Jhana also said the manager was unavailable to speak with me to resolve the issue and I should return in a few hours, or wait 24-48 hours to get a call from someone. \n",

Alyssa looked into the system and saw that Jessica's package (12 waxes) had been added to my account, and my package (4 waxes) had been added to Jessica's. She said she would need to file a form with corporate to swap our packages and it would take some time. I left the store with the issue unresolved. Thankfully within an hour I received a call from Alyssa saying she was able to resolve the issue and transfer my packages under my name. I appreciated that she had actually looked into the issue. That said, I was so turned off by the receptionist that I had to write this review. If I had not been persistent about getting this fixed, it would have gone unnoticed until either myself or Jessica came in for our next wax and realized our packages were all messed up. At that point, there would have been no way of knowing who our actual package had been issued to. \n",

      " I am a local, born and raised, and have come here many times. I had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to show them around the funk zone. We stopped in to grab a glass of wine, and two of us decided to use the restroom. Apparently there is a sign on the door that says only person can use the restroom at a time. However, I did not see the sign, which was an honest mistake on my part. My friend and I went into the bathroom together. Less than 30 seconds after going into the restroom, we heard a loud banging on the door. This happened three times during the 2-3 minutes max we were in the restroom. I hadn't even had a chance to wash my hands yet when my friend opened the door to see who was banging on the door, and this very drunk girl comes running in, screaming at us. She proceeded to pull down her pants in front of us and started peeing. I have never seen anything like it. She accused of us of taking too long and causing her to pee on the floor. When we walked outside, we saw a puddle of her pee on the floor. Then an employee came up to us and told us that we shouldn't have been in there together, and we said sorry we didn't know. \n",
      "\n",
      "We then went back to grab our glasses of wine that we had ordered and tried to find a place to sit. As I was walking through the doorway, a girl bumped into me. It was the girl who peed on the floor. She then called me a racist name and walked outside. We ignored her and decided to stay and let it go. One of my other friends went up to order another glass of wine, and they refused to serve her, telling us that we had been \"kicked out.\" When we asked her why, she said it was because there were two of us in the bathroom. Then, a second employee with a British accent came walking over, and said in an EXTREMELY RUDE manner, \"You guys were kicked out a long time ago, I don't know what you are still doing here.\" I tried to explain to her that we had no idea we were kicked out, but she wouldn't listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, someone (maybe the manager) else came over, and told us that we had to go because \"we caused a girl to pee on their floor\" because we were in the bathroom too long. We tried to tell them that we were only in the bathroom for a couple of minutes. We weren't even in there long enough for me to wash my hands because this girl was being so disruptive and rude. However, it made no difference. They didn't even give us a chance to explain our side of the story. Meanwhile, they let a racist drunk girl stay even though she was the one who peed on their floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, to top it off, when we walked outside, that same girl was out on the sidewalk drinking the wine from this establishment, which is illegal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now normally I would never write a bad review. In fact, I have never written one before. However, this was the rudest treatment of any establishment that I have ever seen. It was especially frustrating because I was showing my friends around my town, and to be treated this way was unacceptable. I will never go back to this place, which is sad, because I liked it before this happened. \n",

I've been sitting here for twenty minutes lost in homework planning on being here for way too long to write several essays and order numerous drinks. However I didn't feel like getting one the second I sat down. One of the baristas just came up to me and basically accused me of not getting a drink. Our conversion, \"did we get you a drink\" \"no I haven't ordered one yet\" \"are you going to\" \"yes, in do time\" \"thanks\" Do I have to order one the second I get here?!?!

He could have easily told me nicely that that was a rule they had, but instead he made me feel like a complete idiot. The woman working was nice and helped me out. But they charged me for two rings that didn't even fit and then tried telling me to wait a couple months and try to stretch out my hole instead of just offering to refund the money. They also tried telling me most places don't sell 20 gauges and then I went to the tattoo shop across the street and they told me completely otherwise.

The sales people seemed helpful and answered my questions at first. I even came back a couple times before I made a decision on the car. On saturday July 2nd I made the deposit and was promised a car the following friday (July 8) latest. I patiently waited checking back a couple times throughout the week to get updates on the situation to make sure everything went smoothly. Not only was it extremely time consuming because they just didn't wanna help you out until your presence became an annoyance to them, they also kept lying to get me to leave, giving me deadlines they never met. They constantly told me that they would call me back and let me know but they never did. Today 12 days have past, and they still did not give me a proper response regarding the fate of the promised car. Today someone actually picked up the phone and after giving me a very unclear response about the fate of the car shut down the phone without letting me respond. Very rude. Who is going to reimburse me 9 days (taking out 3 days that they initially promised to deliver) of not being able to work? On average I lost more than a $1000 already by not being able to work and I still don't know what will happen.

My friend who used to work at a country club didn't even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time, I was truly regretful for tipping at all.

It was my first apt so I had made apt for exam, X-ray and cleaning. I wanted to reschedule than but she told me I can t because I bought a Groupon and I can t be rescheduled. Just that experience put a bad taste in my mouth I still drove and cam in 10 min late I filled the paperwork and went inside to the room downstairs. The tv wasn t on the music was only playing, she took x-rays and than started scraping my teeth which now they hurt. They didn t hurt before!

We ordered the chicken saltimbocca ($23) and the chicken picante ($15) each with a side of linguine w/ the garlic butter sauce and each came with a side of escarole soup and side salad. We ordered this for pickup so they then told us that we had to bring them containers to put the soup in because they didn't have any.

So I called them up and the lady that answered the phone gave me to the guy that took the order and I explained that we didn't get the right sauces and he said in a very rude tone \"well I didn't hear your wife or your girlfriend or whoever that was say that you wanted that sauce. Its an extra 2 dollars for that sauce. I can make it for you and you can come back up and it will be 4 bucks\". I was so caught off guard and didn't know what to say I just said \"no I wont be doing that\" and hung up. After I hung up all the great comebacks that I missed out on.

Don't even bother waiting for your server to take your food and drink order; call them over unless you want to be there for a couple hours or more, since the food also takes a while to prepare. This would be one thing if it was the best sushi in town, but it most certainly is not. Fish is fresh, but it is at pretty much any other mid-priced sushi restaurant in a 7 mile radius due to the town's location. Both times I've come neither toro nor uni we're on the menu...we're in Santa Barbara! Uni is shipped internationally from this city, you'd think a local restaurant could manage to have some on hand. Their specialty rolls are heavily covered in baked mayonnaise and overly battered and fried. So, go simple the next time, I thought. I ordered a spicy scallop roll, a salmon skin roll, and soft shell crab to split. Spicy scallop roll again had too much mayonnaise, though it was wrapped very well, and the soft shell crab was heavily tempura battered so much that there was more batter than crab. They were out of salmon skin, which would have been OK if they'd told me from the get-go. Instead, they brought my other food out and said they were out of salmon skin. Great, now if I order another dish it will come out later. \n",

The place is very cozy and a nice atmosphere. I would probably come back just hopefully won't get the same waitress.

I complained about what was going on and I was told that \"oh honey those people were here earlier and lost their numbers\" OH YEA RIGHT.

So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers.

I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \"do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!\" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\" (very politely) He then came back with \"ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind\" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers.

      ">>> 3.0 I have visited Aldine twice: the first time, I mostly enjoyed the meal with the exception of slow service ... the second time, the experience was dampened by sassy service. First, in terms of food, I think most of the dishes are actually quite good. Some are creative (maybe a little too creative for some people's palettes), and the misses seemed to involve pasta both times. Second, the cocktails are also very good; I like that they make their own syrups and offer creative cocktails with quality ingredients. The food and the drinks make me want this restaurant to succeed, but I seriously don't understand what's going on with the servers, hence 2 stars knocked down. As I said, the first time I came here, service was slow, so dinner took somewhere between 3 and 4 hours (and it's not like we had a 7-8 course tasting menu), but it wasn't a big negative since I was enjoying my dinner company and there wasn't a hint of rudeness. The second time, the server seemed annoyed with our table, possibly because there was a vegan in the group who was a little nervous. Most places such as this one should be able to accommodate dietary restrictions without fuss (and it's not like we were in a David Chang establishment, where it's expressly advertised that no restrictions would be accommodated). Maybe having a vegan diner was annoying to the chef, although I doubt it, but the server gave enough sass and attitude (even strongly hinting at the number of plates we need to order) that we really were not feeling warm and friendly vibes dining there. Was he annoyed that there were only 3 or 4 other tables with patrons (on a Thursday night) and that his collective earnings from tips for the night were not going to be what he thought? Who knows, but if that keeps up I will find it difficult to recommend this place to friends ... a shame given the culinary talent in the kitchen. \n",

I apologized but he continued to yell at me on the phone. When I went down to pick up my food he continued to harass me outside of my apartment and yell at me after he gave me the food.

I was back in town for a 15th year college reunion and decided to reminisce by coming here again on a MONDAY night for a good friend's birthday celebration.  When I arrived at 6:30pm - the restaurant had many empty seats.  We were a party of 5 but only 3 of us arrived early.  We were seated immediately.  The rest of the party came about 20 minutes later.  After 5 minutes - our waitress came over with an irritated \"Is the rest of your party coming soon?\"  After another 5 minutes - they basically said very rudely \"Where are they?\"  Meanwhile - there were still MANY empty tables (another table of 5 open) - I looked and there was nobody waiting.    When the rest of the party arrived, the waitress came over immediately to announce the specials of the day before my brother's butt touch his seat!  They're undercurrent was still hostile at best.  The restaurant did not fill up until 30 minutes after our entire party arrived and no more than 2 people were waiting at a time to be seated the entire time we were there.  I felt that the waitresses were rude and acted like it was some kind of sacred privilege to eat at Dmitris.  To add insult to injury - the food was NOT the way I remembered it.  The grilled octopus was dry and did not taste fresh.  The rest of the dishes were okay-good but not spectacular.  I feel that Dmitris is resting on its previous laurels.  I read a few yelp reviews and many complained about the rude waitstaff.  I will not patronized this establishment again and informed my Philly friends and family of the same.

And sometimes they're a bit reluctant to elaborate and describe items when deliberating between the vast array of treats they offer.

This is thanks completely to the *servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day, however, we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always, but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early, to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival, we were told that, since we did not place a deposit, there was not a table for us. Yes, they could see our reservation in the system, they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation, a month and a half prior. However, they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us, and since they were unsuccessful, they didn't hold us a table (again, they can see our reservation, they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further, had they needed a deposit, that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus, how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to \"one of the owners\". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly, let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was \"one of the owners\" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house, away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never, as a customer, been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And, no, I can assure you, we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So, despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past, I will now make sure that everyone we know, meet, work with, or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And, clearly, we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving, we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead! \n",

When we asked about the wines, all he would say is the name and the year, then plop the bottle in front of us so we could read it ourselves. He was honestly quite rude, as if we were inconveniencing him. The other lady working gave us very nice descriptions of each wine - we were very happy when she helped us out instead!\n",

      "Alyssa (the manager), called me this morning to apologize for rushing through my question yesterday.  She also advised that she would be doing some extra training with Stephanie to work on her front desk servicing skills.  I was very pleased to hear that Alyssa took accountability, and apologized... instead of giving me a bunch of excuses. I was very pleased with her outreach, and I was pleased at that point.  On top of that, she went above and beyond to make it up to me by giving me a credit on my account. I didnt expect that nor did i demand that, i was happy with her response.  This shows good character in a manager. Owning it and not making excuses.\n",

      "\n",
      "2.) Lea, my Wax Specialist (both times) is the only reason why I come back to this place. She's friendly, quick, precise, and makes me feel comfortable. It's a shame her colleagues don't achieve this much.\n",

      "\n",
      "The first time i went there, Stephanie greeted me and wanted to get rid of me ASAP. She took my license and said she would give it back when I came out. She didnt tell me why, and when I asked, she snapped back at me and said she needs to put my information in the computer and smirked at me like I was an idiot. I never leave my license with anyone, and I think I have a right to ask why you need my license. How long does it take to type in my name and address anyway?  Did I say I wanted the company to have my address anyway?  Why not ask before you take information from your clients.  When my wax was over, I came out and paid, and still Stephanie wanted me out of her face. It was my first time here, so I had some questions about the products and packages, and she had no time for it. Oh, I'm sorry that I'm delaying you by asking you to sell me more stuff. Needless to say, even though I wanted to buy the package, her lack of enthusiam or selling skills, had me just walk away.\n",

She responded to my question, but didnt answer it, bc she didnt want to understand my question. Sorry, I'm a new customer still, and I would like to know the answer to one question without a respond like \"they will do as much or as little as you want\"... umm.. that doesnt answer my question. but thanks?  After my wax, I checked out with Devin, I think that was her name.. she was super polite and willing to answer my questions.  I bought the package with her. And i could not believe Alyssa was a manager?!!! What a terrible way to treat your customer, and show how you act in front of other peers.... so it becomes contagious. Maybe Devin should become the manager. Lindsay seems like she has her head screwed on straight too.\n",

      "Not at all true....\n",
      "\n",
      "To start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos! \n",
      "\n",
      "The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Despite a recent renovation, the Black Sheep is dingy and dirty and the sloppiest, most unattractive hostess (that is until I saw our waitress) sat us at our table upstairs. Although it was 10 pm on a Wednesday night, she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. Perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. The waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. No makeup, no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. I ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients, but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. I showed her the menu and corrected her. She was rude and had a nasty attitude. I guess I would too if I looked like her. It was $30 for a burger, a salad and two Diet Cokes.The staff is arrogant, the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don't care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat, high cholesterol, high calorie greasy food.

Travis the store manager and his team were extremely rude when we drove 60 miles last night to pick up BF's pre-ordered Destiny game. As a store director my BF was called in to work a night shift the same night of the midnight release - He was upset as he would be unable to pick up his preorder and accessories he wanted (big nerd I know) Me and my friend drove over to pick up the game with receipt in hand & gamestop card. However due to new policies we couldn't even pick up the game!? WHAT? since when is a receipt insufficient evidence to pick up a game. \n",

      "I was not as upset at the fact that new policy came in but the way we were treated was AWFUL! The whole team ganged up on us when we were attempting to figure out what we could do before driving back another 60 miles home. Not only was he pointing out in a very rude way that the pre-order had x amount of money down (in front of other clients) but he was rude enough to bring it up a second time in order to transfer the pre-order to another account. \n",

      "We left after we were ridiculed by the entire team led by Travis & I am attempting to get a hold of someone about this, even after my large Twitter rant which has gone no where! Customers want to be treated better! This was by far the WORST experience I have ever gone through! \n",

I frequent El Camino for the pitchers and the pig wings which are unreal but last night was really sub par. The waitress told us she hasn't worked in a while and didn't know the draft beers which was weird, and she seemed as though she was either having a bad night or was just super rude. \n",

They came out piled high, sans beans, covered in all fatty pieces of brisket and topped with a bag of lettuce. The cheese was tasted like a liquid version of mayo. Let's just say they were bad. So, when she finally came around 16 minutes later, I apologized and told her they were really gross. Unfortunately, she acted as though I personally offended her and was passive aggressive and super rude the rest of the night. I ordered wings and she didn't once speak to us again. Hopefully she was having a bad night because otherwise, I couldn't come back based on how we were treated. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Well, honestly if I could give zero star than I would; because it is extremely Americanized not close to being Indian. The items on the menu are a complete creation of the owner.  For example, There is nothing like salad chat or a tandoori tikka chat in india. So if you are looking to eat real Indian chat, than I would not go there. I don't know how the place got all the positive reviews, maybe some free food for reviews, who knows. But this review is coming from an Indian who loves Indian food and has explored many Indian restaurant serving Chat across the country.

      ">>> 1.0 I gave this restaurant 5 stars 3 years ago. Since then I have had several dinners and parties there and recommend them to multiple friends. But after the second horrible experience there I have to speak out. (Last year I was racially profiled. The waitress would not let us in and asked me if I was able to pay the restaurant minimum. Her attitude changed immediately after my Chinese husband showed up.) I let the first incident slide but this one sent me through the roof. I just helped my friend's family plan a 40th birthday party for her and the night manager was one of the rudest people I've ever met. Let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in Chinatown and we've always helped support his business. To make a long story short: I booked a birthday party for 7:00. The family came early to set up, as he said it was allowed. At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can't stay there all night. I reminded him that we have a 7:00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said \"So what I don't care, it doesn't matter be out by 9.\" He was yelling at me across the restaurant. He was so unprofessional and hurtful, especially since we've always supported this business. At 8:55 he came in and said we could stay longer, but I couldn't even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway. His verbal abuse practically ruined my night. I love the food and the karaoke room, but tonight was my last visit there. I STRONGLY recommend another restaurant. There are so many other restaurants that will give you the Chinatown experience and not treat you and your guests like crap. So, so, disappointed! \n",

Every time I have come and asked one of the ladies a question at the register, you would have thought I just asked for her to come fan me and feed me donuts. Super super rude. No smile. Rolling eyes. Hey lady with the glasses, if you are so miserable...get another job. Lucky the donuts are good, coffee is terrible though. \n",

We ordered clam casino, sautéed mussels in red sauce, veal parm and eggplant parm.\n",

Plus the check came to $180 with 18% tip included and i explained i needed to charge a certain amount in cards and the rest in cash, i even wrote the amounts and card numbers on the ticket but after waiting a long time for her to bring the change she didnt bring any change and overcharged the cards. A total of $210 dlls instead of $180 she was charging more than $50dlls in tip. Thats an abuse. Im very very dissapointed and her only excuse was that she was too busy. \n",

I asked if he could open me and my friends wine bottles and out of no where a cork screw lands on the table right in front of  me. He literally threw a cork screw at me for me to open my own wine bottle. He then proceeds to write my order and I saw him write it down with his pen on his pad. Food comes out and I don't get my meal, everyone is eating and he said he didn't write it down wanted to know what I got and he'll put in the order now.  He then places soup in front of me and says \"here this will keep you preoccupied while you wait\".... Oh thanks! Everyone in my party is finished eating so I tell him to please just cancel it if the chef didn't start making it and he goes.. \"ok\" and walks away...not are you sure? it'll be a minute... So he brings out the food anyway and I said I'm sorry I don't want it anymore thanks though, because I'm beyond annoyed at this point and he goes well \"the chef didn't even want to make it...

First off, there are absolutely no seats in the place, which isn't always a bad thing to stand and have a good time; however, you weren't even given the option. Second, the staff excluding the bartender were all rude. Third, I was unfamiliar with the bar considering it was my first time and I asked a staff member if they play live music all night and he informed me that they play club and dance music after 10 p.m. Which was a lie. Fourth, the drinks were the biggest disappointment for me. The website and menu states how the biggest buckets can be shared among several people, I drank one of those and felt absolutely nothing! It tasted like juice and it was $40! Finally, as I stated I was not drunk in any way nor was I acting drunk, and after going next door to the club Down I decided to go back to Howl at the Moon where the door men rudely yelled at me that I wasn't allowed back in because I was \"too intoxicated\" absolutely ridiculous!! Like I said I am not one to act all crazy and I was not even slightly buzzed. I went to Xfinity after I got \"kicked out\" and had a much better time! I will NEVER  go here again, it really put a damper on my birthday!! \n",

Kind of annoying that I'd been standing there patiently for ten minutes instead of rudely just jumping in. I eventually was allowed to order a kid's grilled cheese which was huge and excellent. I really wanted a veggie burger but was told the kitchen was too backed up. It came with fries too and those were cooked really well. We shared onion rings and they were ridiculously good but you can't eat a whole order yourself. I feel like one order is good for four people to share.

The first time I was there, I sat outside and enjoyed a nice evening and long conversation with a friend. Tonight, however, I sat inside with a friend and after having been there for 1 hour and 15 minutes and ordering two appetizers and two entrees we were promptly asked by our server to leave to free up the table. I thought this was quite rude. The restaurant does not take reservations because it wants to have a relaxed neighborhood feel, but it does not feel very neighborly or relaxed to kick your customer out after an hour and fifteen minutes. Perhaps it would be better to take reservations and not rush their guests. \n",

Although the restaurant had only one table filled when we arrived, hostess seated the three of us at a very small table for two, then seated someone right next to us.  She then complained that we were oozing over our table space onto the other people.  Hostess was VERY rude.  Beverages were good, but service was very slow - also odd considering most of the restaurant was empty.  Food was sub-par with tater tots and shrimp being so overcooked that they were inedible.  Pulled BBQ sandwich had so much fat in it it was impossible to eat.  This was such a disappointment since we are big Garces fans and eat often at his other restaurants.  Maybe this was just a bad day for them. \n",

We got to the restaurant with a bottle of wine and both of us were very hungry. We were seated at a table, given menus and the hostess opened our bottle. We chatted a bit, had some wine, and looked over the menu. The first 5 minutes we were there the waiter came over 3 times to ask if we were ready to order the menu is huge so it took us some time. We finally ordered, food came out quickly, very quickly. The server paid no attention to the fact that some of our belongings were on the table (keys, cell phones, etc) before we could move anything he placed our plates directly on top of everything. We ate, food was good not great, we split 2 rolls and a bento box, with the intention of ordering more if this was not filling enough. Before we finished eating we were brought our check, which destroyed any possibility of ordering more. We ate all the sushi and were picking at the bento box and drinking our wine when our server came over to take our check, my friend stopped him because we had not put our money in it yet and explained that we were still eating and drinking and not ready to pay. Then the waiter said \"So you can't pay your bill and finish your food?\" so so so rudely. We both stared at him in shock as he continued to rush us to pay him and get out of the restaurant. I have never experienced anything like it, mind you we were not even there for an hour when this occurred. We were so uncomfortable we did not finish the food or wine and just left. We won't be back, mostly because it was the weirdest, most rushed, rudest service I have ever experienced. \n",

I had been to the former restaurant, Chaucer's, once before, and the transformation was drastic.

The flavors are sophisticated and complex. Two large pieces come to an order.\n",

      "Entrees: I was in the mood to go light, so I ordered the onion soup ($8) with a side of brussels sprouts ($5). What made the onion soup distinct was the addition of some kind of wheat beer (I think) to the broth, which stood up to the strength of the cheese and paired well with the sweet, caramelized onions. My only complaint: some of the cheese on top of the soup burned at the edges under the broiler. My side of brussels didn't achieve as high marks. The brussels were overcooked as well as the accompanying bacon. The flavors hit the mark, blending well, but the execution fell short.\n",

Not as much could be said of the potatoes, done in a hash brown/latke style, which seemed old and overdone.\n",

Warm raw fish is not good and it grossed me out to where I couldn't eat it. I could have let this slide, but they also gave me a regular shrimp tempura roll instead of the one I ordered and paid for that cost double. I gave them a call about the roll and mentioned the warm salmon. The guy was super rude and told me that he's \"been packaging sushi for 10 years and no one ever complained about this.\" Ok, jerk. I've been eating sushi for 10 years and never complained about this because it's never happened. \n",

THEN a BAR MAID, I think her name was ALLY, felt it necessary to invite herself into our ordering fiasco and made matters 100 times worse. She insisted I took the burger, asked me 3-4 times if I wanted the new burger, bringing it to my table obsessively. (sounds like good customer service, but was quite the opposite)\n",

I could hear the BAR MAID at the food counter rambling on and on about the burger, my table, my son and was not only rude, but not fit for the service industry. My son left the restaurant and waited in the car for me and my friend to finish.  This employee had no idea of the situation, but inserted herself in our dining experience.

EVERY time there seems to be a bunch of people \"working\" there, all doing nothing and barely acknowledge you when you come in.  Even if they say order will be ready in 30 min, and you come 30 min later to an empty, dingy takeout joint, they 1) totally ignore you, rudely going on with their conversation  2) did not start your order and give you no indication that they plan to start it soon.  I would say guesstimate double the wait time they say.  Also, got a large cheese pizza here last time, and half of the cheese was slid off the pizza, crust so thin and soggy that it had no structural integrity for the pieces that did have cheese- so unappetizing that I didn't eat it.\n",

After being rude AF (snatching my hand, fucking up my nail shape and insisting that no one in the entire place can do ombré nails) she thought it was ok to say to me, you like bcuz I'm not changing it!  To which I replied, you're going to do what I'm paying you to do. And if I don't like it then you'll change it! This lady sat back in her chair huffing and puffing after her manager told her to do one nail to make sure it comes out the way I want. All I asked for was an ombré white ya'll. Paint the nail short two coats then long one coat. It's not rocket science. So I asked her, are you having a bad day? I needed to know before I flipped the fuck out. She looks at me like she doesn't understand. So I say, YOU , BAD DAY?! She stares but doesn't reply. At this point my nails are almost painted and I let it go. I hit my nail on the side of the dryer. The manager fixes it right next to Amy (that's what her name tag says). I watch as she smiles and nods at the request of another customer (one who doesn't look like me). I sit there a little longer waiting for a snatch of the hand, a press of the drill to a finger a bit to gruffly, a roll of an eye, a huff and a puff... Nothing! I wanted to say to the customer, be careful she's got an attitude. But it was clear her experience wasn't that of mine. So I return to the drying table, escorted by the manager and I tell him, this is my third time here. Today's experience was not a pleasant one. You should speak to Amy about her attitude and how she treats customers. To which he says, awwww it's ok, it's ok, and pats me on the back. The bottom line.... I've gotta find a new nail shop! I have never had an experience like this and it's unfortunate to have to have one such as this today. I'm sure my not tipping her was a topic of conversation as she was speaking in her native tongue to another technician as I was sitting in front of her. Bad service doesn't get rewarded and I'm just not that girl who thinks that giving you my money will help change your views about folk who look like me! \n",

No customer service skills, rude tone, and he told my boyfriend that I was being unreasonable behind my back just because I requested another roommate assignment as part of their roommate matching service. Also when first coming to tour the apartment building, David was not only rude, but didn't even know his way around the building or how to use the keys to open the door.

After receiving my key and unlading my vehicle I went to my room (Room 32) where I put my belongings down.  I remained in the room for approximately 20 minutes.  During that time the phone at the front desk (located approximately 10-15 feet from the front door of my hotel room) rang several times.  Additionally, several guests came in and out o the lobby.  While in the room it was as if I was in the lobby.  The sound from the phone, front desk representative, and guests was extremely loud.  I asked the desk if there was another room.  There was, but it was two room suite and cost a considerable amount more.  I was offered the room at the increased price, but declined.  I asked to not be charged, or refunded if I already was.  The front desk representative named Andy told me he couldn't do that.  I asked to talk to a manager.  He stated the manager wasn't on site.  I asked if we could call the manager.  He said he did not have the manager's number and couldn't call.  He was extremely rude!  I continued to request to we call the manager or give me a number I could call.  I explained that if he wasn't empowered to resolve the issue that maybe his manager was and we could work things out.  He smirked at me and then I told him I wasn't interest in playing games and asked if I would need law enforcement or an attorney to resolve the matter.  He finally dialed the manager's number and spoke with he manager (Christian Mercier - 805-963-4418).  The manager refused to talk to me.  He also said he would not refund the cost of the room unless the room was resold. \n",

Given the crowds and the bar otherwise being nothing special, I would avoid as a late night destination except for convenience if you're staying in the hotel. I also had some strange experiences with the servers and bartenders at night. They ran out of clean glasses   and we had to wait for our drinks. Not a problem, except when they finally brought them they did so without the water my friend requested. She asked again and they responded that there were no clean glasses...while making another alcoholic drink in one. They were clearly prioritizing the paid drinks but it was obvious and rude.

It was uncomfortably quiet upstairs but no biggie. We were greeted soon after we settled and our drink orders were taken. 2 margaritas and 2 waters were ordered w/o ice. The server returns with one water full of ice. We questioned it after he ran downstairs but. I could wait for my water. My friend had to move her car before 10 and we had set a 15 min timer for her to leave. That's how I knew the drinks were taking a long time. On her way out my friend stopped by the bar  to get someone's attention and to ask why it was taking so long since hardly anyone was there. She just decided to leave since she saw our drinks just starting to be made. We got our drinks at 10:03. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we waited for our food the server was hovering . I get that we were the only ones upstairs but where was this attention when we ordered our drinks? The food came and I had to ask for clean cutlery and my friend had to ask for ketchup for her fries. Being someone who has worked in the service industry, I feel like there are certain things you shouldn't have to ask for. He asks us, \"so do you want hot sauce too?\" I thought that was odd because what is the implication? We just want ketchup and clean spoons. He returns with a clean spoon and we have to remind him about the ketchup. I order a second margarita and the server comes back with a martini glass the size of a shot glass. Their glasses were already on the smaller side. I find it funny that he tried to quickly take away my friends margarita which she wasn't even done with so I wouldn't see the difference but I did and took a picture. He apologized and surprisingly quickly came back with the rest of my drink. He proceeds to do more hovering and eventually drops the bill. We payed when we were ready and the he informed us after seeing more than one method of payment that we would have to tell him how much we wanted on the cards. Why in the world would we not tell him that? We hand him the payment and I ask to speak with a manager and this is when things went downhill. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had every intention of paying for my meal and tipping my server accordingly. But what I didn't know was that the manager was going to add fuel to very slow burning fire. I honestly just wanted to inform him that despite such positive experiences I've had here, this was the poorest. I brought two of my friends here and as first timers they said they wouldn't return. (They had increased their prices last I had been there. I thought it was slightly unreasonable because I don't think anything about the quality had improved) I try and tell him first about how it took about 20 minutes for our drinks to come and he was immediately on the defense. He tells me that he is personally responsible for making the drinks and he knows for a fact it didn't take 20 minutes. He says \"I think you know margaritas aren't the easiest drink to make. It's not a quick pour like a beer; it's a cocktail\". Excuse me? I know how long it takes to make a margarita and I know a margarita is a cocktail. Mind you he tells me this after cutting me off and with a pompous attitude. I was quite shocked. So I proceed to tell him my intentions like I previously stated. (Maybe he thought I was trying to get money off the bill or something) I didn't want anything from him, I just wanted to inform him of the unusual experience so they could do something about. He wasn't getting it as he continued to be on the defense and take the stance that they were right so I was automatically wrong. I tell him sir I've already paid and he says he knows, he has my money already. It seemed to be a lost cause so I tell him that he doesn't seem to care about my opinion so he got dismissed. He threatens to call the police on me and I welcomed it. I haven't done anything wrong and we were about to leave anyway. Of course more words were exchanged and even my friends tried to chime in but you get the gist. Long story short, I left no tip, I will never return, I will constantly demote them to anyone who will hear me, the \"manager\" was rude, arrogant, impatient, irrational, and a poor representation of Rotten Ralph's and the reason why I will NEVER RETURN.ps. I'm sorry to the server who didn't get a tip at all but I was mad as hell for the low class treatment...and you were a bit weird. \n",

The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner.

We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\n",

      "We eat at a hotel restaurant even its food is mediocre and everything is overpriced, because we expect to be treated really nicely by well trained staff.  Well, the experience at this hotel restaurant was very unique.  We (five of us) stayed at the Hotel Monaco to celebrate my birthday, and reserved Red Owl Tavern based on many good reviews.  When we arrived at the tavern, we were taken to a table for four.  We told the gentleman that we were a party of five and we had a reservation.  He told us that he would bring a chair.  So, one of us sat on a chair that was placed in an aisle.  We then saw the area in the back where a group of five or so just left.  So we asked if we could move there.  The waitress told us that those tables were reserved.  I told her that we too \"reserved\" a table for five not four, and it was my birthday.  She told me that she would \"see what she could do.\"  Soon, a lady came to our table and said, \"Those tables are reserved.\"  I told her that we had made a reservation for five.  She said, \"Sorry, this is only what we have\" and patted on my shoulder and left.  My husband was upset, but I said it was OK.  I decided not to let this ruin my birthday.  After that, however, few things went right. They brought pasta with cheese even though I asked the waitress no cheese due to my daughter's allergy.  So, my very hungry daughter had to wait another 20 minutes for her pasta with no cheese.  We had to ask why the bread, the side, and my father's dish were so late when other dishes were already at the table.  When the bread came after a long wait, it had butter on it despite the fact we told the waitress my daughter was allergic to dairy.  My 81 year old father's dish (Caesar salad with chicken) finally came after everyone finished their food which was more than an hour after we ordered all the food.  While all these things happening, we saw the area we had hoped to move in order to have more room which was \"reserved\" completely empty.  Toward the end of the meal, a couple of people were seated at one of the empty tables.  Our waitress was very apologetic.  She was never rude.  She took the pasta, Caesar salad, bread, off the bill, which was nice.  Would I like to dine at Red Owl Tavern again to deal with all the stress, especially for a special occasion like a birthday?  Absolutely not.  I hope the general manager of the Hotel Monaco (Mr. James Adamson) will make more effort to train people at the restaurant at the Hotel. \n",

      "\n",
      "I've been here many times and always had a pleasant experience. However,  I went here over the weekend with my boyfriend. while we were there he started feeling very bad (he ended up having the flu). He tried using the bathroom but it was locked. He had to basically run from the back to the front of the restaurant to make it out the front door. He got sick right outside. He was extremely embarrassed but did not have any other options. A woman who worked there proceeded to walk out and yell at him as if he did it on purpose. He was so mortified that he just left. After a text from him, I asked for the check and headed to checkout. This is where I headed to the register to find the entire staff laughing at his expense. when I let them know that I was with him the woman ringing me up said- \"well why didn't he try to go into the bathroom?\" I let her know that it wasnt' available. Another girl even implied that he did it on purpose. I was then asked by my server \"well I hope last night was fun, was it worth it?\" - I let the entire staff know that he was not in fact, hungover, but actually quite sick. Although it was embarrassing for the both of us, and inconvenient for the restaurant, they are in the hospitality industry and probably shouldn't have yelled at one of their customers for being sick. They also shouldn't have assumed that he was drunk/hungover. And speaking about him infront of everyone, not knowing that I was with him was extremely rude.\n",

I was on the dancefloor dancing when i felt an extreme pain in my foot. When i looked down I noticed blood gushing out of my foot. I ran over to our booth to realized that a large piece of glass had pierced through my shoe and up into my foot. At this point i got the attention of the bouncers to help clean up the blood and my foot. The bouncers were extremely rude and declined to give me a free drink because in their eyes it was MY FAULT for stepping on the glass. They kept claiming i had no shoes on so they were not liable for it, when i did IN FACT have my shoes on the glass was just large and sharp enough to pierce through my shoe and into my foot. At this point i had had enough. I declined signing any waver because i thought how they handled the situation was extremely rude, ridiculous, and inconsiderate. All I wanted at that point was to get out of that place. \n",

      "Being in town for a trade show, I went there today for lunch. I ordered two of my favorites: clay pot noodles and ipoh bean sprouts. The clay pot noodles is a big clay bowl of egg noodles, various veggies, calamari, pork, shrimp and eggs in a yummy sauce - somewhere half way between a broth and a gravy. It arrives still simmering at your table so do not touch the pot!! Today, the noodles seemed somewhat undercooked but overall the dish was pretty good. The bean sprouts though were phenomenal as always - perfectly blanched (not soggy or raw) in the special house sauce (a variation of a soy based sauce).\n",
      "\n",
      "My other old favorites are the mango chicken, which is sweet and somewhat spicy and comes served in the mango shells, and the beef rendang, a curried beef dish where the beef is nice and tender and the sauce is pretty dry. I've also tasted the beef chow fun and it was nice and dry (I don't like gravy gook). My boyfriend loves their cracked pepper crab too...\n",
      "\n",
      "They have several locations, mainly in Manhattan, but this one in Philly has one of the better menus - they vary. I have yet to try the Penang in Boston, but would love to when the chance arises. Once again, they ONLY take CASH and do not speak good English. You also cannot make reservations and the lines can get crazy sometimes - definitely not a place for a quick dinner meal. I mean, they are VERY quick once you sit down and order - in fact, sometimes I feel a bit rushed, but the wait can be daunting...\n",
      "\n",
      "So, overall I like Penang and I'd recommend it for a fun meal - especially as a group so you can try a lot of different things. The two reasons why they lost the 5th star is that they don't take credit cards, the service is often rushed and this one older waiter (who I think is one of the managers/owners cause he's been there since the first time I ate there about 8 years ago) is SO rude and unhappy. If he ends up serving me, I always feel totally unwelcome. \n",

The burger was smaller than I thought it would be but it was a perfect size for me.  The brioche was a bit dry and not really flavorful and I ended up taking the top part off (too much bread).

I walked in and everyone was just sitting around doing nothing, they were on their phones and not even asking if we needed help. I literally had to bother one of the representatives to even look at me and when she finally did, she just gave me this look like, \"what the fuck does this little girl want?\" I'm a college student and my phone was stolen two nights ago so I went in to get a new phone. When I explained what happened and that my mom had already spoken to a verizon customer service rep who told us it would only cost 100, she laughed in my face and told me about all these extra charges that would make it closer to 200. Then when I had her explain the extra charges and information to my mom over the phone, she was completely rude and soooo disrespectful. Granted, my mom can be a bit abrasive at times but I was listening to the entire conversation and it did not warrant the response that Brenda (the sales rep) had. My mom was talking about how she had received different information than what Brenda had told her, this bitch actually held the phone away from her face IN FRONT OF ME. How dumb could you be?! My friend and I also overheard her talking about how irritating my mom was being when she went into the back room and even 30 feet away from us. She made several remarks and comments about my mom and the information she was \"trying to make her understand,\" and I was literally infuriated. Then once I had paid for my phone I was on my friends phone telling my mom the total and explaining the process etc and Brenda didnt even say have a nice day or goodbye once the sale was finished, she simply walked into the back room without anther word. I told one of the other very nice sales women that I was very disappointed and she seemed more sincere than the lady who had worked with me. I really wish I'd spoken to her instead.

I opened up the bun and dumped a bunch of salt and pepper on it.  The server wasn't rude or anything, but she wasn't friendly or nice.  When my boyfriend asked for a water, she said okay but proceeded to clear two tables, wipe them down, go stand at the bar and check her phone, talk to the bartender, and then finally bring over a water.

They said it was $150 minimum charge and they tacked on 20% tips to it when they did not deserve one penny. They could have told us the minimum charge at the beginning and tell us we should order more to reach $150, but they decided not to. They didn't say anything, they didn't allow us to get anything else too. They made us pay TWICE the amount we should have paid. They were so rude after we paid the bill. They literally rushed us right out of the room by shutting off the karaoke machine and pushing the chairs in. They promised us the room from 4:30 til 7:30, but kicked us out at 7:00 after we paid. The waitress who said 7:30 at the beginning was arguing with us when we asked her about it. She kept saying she knows what she said and that she said 7:00, but every single one of us knew she said 7:30 at the beginning. That was the end of the night....

      ">>> 1.0 So, the owner, Gina, was very rude to me upon dealing with an unhappy customer.  She took over a week to call me back, and in order to even get in touch with her, I had to call the salon more than a couple of times to remind her that I wanted a refund.  When she got me on the phone, she said that she couldn't offer me a refund because I refused to let anybody else in the salon \"fix\" my hair.  HELLO?!... After suffering quite a hackjob of a haircut like I experienced, who would want ANYBODY to cut MORE of their hair off, let alone from the SAME SALON!?... No.  I said that the only solution was to let it grow out.  And she lied and said Bridget had offered me a refund the day I went in to complain, which was not true.  What she said was that in two weeks, if I still didn't like my \"haircut\", that the owner could give me a refund.  So thankfully I did end up getting a refund.  And I better have, because there is no way anybody should have to pay $40 for Bridget to destroy their hair.  But it's a shame, because I'm sure Gina is a good hairstylist.  And that was the person my friend recommended to me.  But because she \"doesn't take any more clients\", I was stuck with Bridget.  So if you go here to get your hair cut, you are getting a young hairstylist fresh out of school who has no real idea what they are doing.\n",
      "So, it's been about a month since my experience here, and it's finally growing out a bit.  I did just take a trip back home to see my normal hairstylist so that she could fix what Bridget did, and she gasped when she saw it.  I was like, \"Don't be mad at me, I didn't touch it.  It was the last person who cut my hair right after the new year!\"  She was like \"I see that, where did all your hair go?!\"  \n",
      "She is an extremely talented hairstylist (hair genius) with decades of experience and her own salon, and the ways she described Bridget's cut are as follows:\n",
      "\"A sophomore haircut.\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, she just worked way too fast, SHAVING your hair down the strand.\"  \n",
      "\"She gave you a mullet.\"\n",

Needless to say that this will be the last time we visit this bar for drinks. Horrible notice. Anyone visiting might want to call to verify when the next \"bar clean\" will be.

I can't believe there was no supervisor on duty to see this woman laying in her chair. When we asked if my niece's daughter could go up, she asked her age. Unfortunately she wasn't old enough to go up but we did not need to be told \"Gangsta Ghetto\" style!  When we finally were able to see my sister, we found no one like this woman anywhere else.

As I was walking out this guy started laughing and saying can you believe that lady? She thought we were open and laughed. So I tried to get back in and the door was locked so I told the guy from the open window that I heard what he said and i thought it was rude! His reply was I couldn't believe you thought we were open, the chairs were on the table and the door was locked. I replied by saying that I walked right in and I had never been here before, there were customers eating also. Anyway he follows me out and says what is your problem. He never apologized or anything.

Ok, it worked.  But for how long?  And they scratched it.   Went back and signed in.  Waited 25 minutes for my turn when a man walked in with a broken screen on his device and TWO guys started to help him.  When I objected that I was there first, I was just blown off.  Had to INSIST that I be helped next.  The employee guy agreed that I should get a new device and took my mailing address.  He said I would get the new one first, then send in the old one.  Another empty box for returning my tablet was sent -- TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.  Third trip into the store, I was told another empty box would be sent and I would have to mail in my tablet...and maybe would get a reconditioned one back.

WTF?! this is a collegetown is it not?! my boyfriend also told me that the baristas made a sweet old man feel embarrassed about asking for sweetener instead of sugar. they're just a tag team of awful - the one who wears the hat and the vest, and the one with an accent. \n",

After coming ill after our meal I decided to come onto here to see how the ratings was and it seems some other people have also gotten sick here too. I personally would give it 0 stars. I did not enjoy my meal due to the rudeness I have encountered since the minute I stepped foot into that establishment, it just made my dinner with my boyfriend pretty bad due to neither of us wanting to be there from the attitudes we were receiving from the the hostess and our waitress.

I was stunned & she finally, & impolitely, said she could send new flowers on Monday but... here's where it gets good... she would have to send the driver back today to pic up the incorrect flowers.

If you call with a concern or let them know about any type of issue, they log it in and I swear they use it against you when it's time to renew your lease and penalize you.  It  actually says when you renew how many times you have called in the course of the year.  If they can't fix a clogged sink, then why should you get charged more the following year???  The staff is extremely rude and confrontational (naturally sweet as can be when you are signing up).  The supposed business center which is for your use has 2 computers and 1 is never working.  They are abrupt and ignorant to deal with.  The maintenance and security are a joke.

After waiting 15 minutes (for a cold cut hoagie, may I add), I finally got it. But it wasn't what I ordered. It had sweet peppers and honey mustard. I then proceeded to say that I ordered banana peppers, in which the rude lady quickly said that they didn't have. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT WHEN I ORDERED?!!?!?! I would have ordered something else.

After that it took 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us again despite the place being empty and there being 2 other serving staff but I did notice a couple of people coming in to pick up take out. The decor is quaint put the place is small and tables are close together so as it began to fill up it did get a little loud. When we finally did order we started with the Duck Fries and Mac and Cheese. The Duck Fries were good, the portion is definitely enough for 2-3 people. I was disappointed with the Mac & Cheese it was just ok  it reminded me of Kraft Mac and cheese it had a runny cheesy consistency I was looking forward to a baked Mac & cheese. Tom like the Mac & Cheese so it really is about your personal preference. Our server read off a long list of specials & I was impressed that she remembered them all,me on the other hand I forgot them & ended  having to get her to remind me again because she disappeared for 10 minutes. I ended up ordering the blackened ravioli which I found out when they brought them out had hot peppers on them, they kindly took them back so I ordered the Ribeye which was worth the $40.00 price tag. Not only was it cooked to perfection the seasoning was out of this world. Since the specials are recited to you and not written down I was surprised when I got the check at the $40 price but it was a good cut of meet that was accompanied with some potatoes and mushroom. Tom had the Northeast Burger and said he liked the Burgers at Gallo's Burger Barn better, again it is all about preference. In conclusion I had a good enough experience that I would try the place again Tom said he would pass, he felt like it was too loud, wait staff could have been more attentive and specials should be written down with the prices published. We both mentioned that to a gentleman who may have been the manager and he said we can always go to their Twitter page to look them up. Not the response that I expected but this is the age of Social Media & I don't think the gentleman was trying to be rude.

The waitress' response when we ordered this:\"'um, really?\"  She also asked us 4 times if we wanted a glass with it...she finally brought the beers out with some glasses and asked AGAIN, if we needed a glass.  YES we said again.  She then attempted to pour the beer into the glass while it fizzed all over and told us she was a bad at pouring beer.  Just give me the glass, I'll pour it myself I told her.

It was extremely rude and unprofessional.  I will not ever go back here.  Then when one employee finally decided to acknowledge us, I asked if they were still open at 8pm because of how poorly we were treated.  Then a second employee decided to help the first employee- put a glove on to start handling food items, and jokingly slapped the first employee in the back of his head/ neck with the food glove!

Not sure if it was the hollandaise sauce or the butter, but something definitely went wrong.  It was the sickest I have been in a long time.  I would contact the owner, but I have spoken with some other locals and have read other reviews from people who mention how rude and unaccomodating the guy is.

Seriously, I have never been treated so badly by someone holding an entry level position in my life. If this isn't your cup of tea, do what I'm going to do next time I'm in Philly and stay a few blocks to the East in a hotel that is closer to Washington Sq park.

She actually has no warmth or friendliness at all when talking to you, and it actually pisses me of and makes me want to frequent a different wax salon. This is a service industry, so when you expect a certain kind of service and you're met with abrupt and rude service, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

We arrived before 11pm, as requested by Managment so we didn't have to pay the cover fee. We arrived at 10:45pm, the place was dead but we were seated at our table immediately. After 20 minutes of waiting at our table, a waitress (Annie) finally greeted us and we ordered 3 bottles to start. After our bottles came out the waitresses immediately walked away. Never once offering to pour our drinks, ask how things were going etc. This was a red flag but we gave her the benefit of the doubt. An hour and a half later, still no sign of our waitress or any other staff member. Not one person came over to see how things were going since they brought our bottles and mixers out. At this point, we were out of ice, mixers and were pretty disappointed in the customer service we had received thus far. After having to go up to the bar twice to ask for our waitress (Annie) she finally came back to check on our table. Not only was she rude and short with us but she really set the tone for our disappointing experience. If we wanted to serve ourselves and have to go to the bar, we wouldn't of reserved table service. Instead, when we asked her for more mixers and ice, we were brushed off and made to feel like we were asking for too much. When our ice and mixers were finally replenished, they were flat. My cousin had to go up to the bar yet again and ask them to replace our mixers. We ending up closing our tab out shortly after this due to the worst customer service I've ever encountered and it basically ruined our night. It gets worse, I received an alert from my credit card company today that our waitress decided to give herself a $680.00 tip on my credit card and my cousins credit card was charged another $816 tip as well!!! Not only was it the worst customer service experience I've ever had but they fraudulently charged my cousin and I's credit cards hundreds of dollars. I'm completely disgusted and feel so violated by what should have been a wonderful celebration and a nice night out, turned into a nightmare. Don't trust this place or their rude, thieving employees!

As a female, the staff hits on you and only assists you if you flirt with them. Been here a few times because it's open late, while hoping each experience would get better. Nope I was wrong!

Ryan at the front desk was incredibly rude, with no capacity for professionalism and no customer service skills whatsoever. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she gets punched in her face one day. Not everyone dealing with a person like her has the ability to remain calm and the confidence to know she is just a front desk person at a 2 star hotel who probably is miserable about it so she takes it out on others. What comes around goes around Ryan and I suggest you get it together. It sounds as though your manager and the owner need to take the same advice.

      "Oh how lovely to wake up Tuesday morning and be peppered with insect bites after sleeping in the second bed in my hotel room at The DoubleTree by Hilton Center City Philadelphia. What else is lovely is how rude and inconsiderate the staff has been on the matter. How they have the nerve to say to me, \"where else have you been?\" Where they have the gaul to lock me out of my room as I handle the matter. You told my boss I was angry and making a scene and drawing other guests into, which is absolutely not true. Why? Because I'm a black woman? Maybe I should have made a scene because clearly the diplomatic route is pointless. Where they insist I am lying because they can't find a bed bug when they \"inspect.\" Absence of evidence is not proof. You know what is proof? The bites in these photos that I did not have Monday night when I showered and went to bed, but definitely had Tuesday morning when I woke up and now on Wednesday are swollen enough to make movements difficult. Where they send a man to a woman's room to come and inspect my things who then mansplains to me about bed bugs. The service at this establishment is already awful and I could let pretty much all of that slide, but I have been HARMED by this hotel and the staff's behavior is just kneading the harm. I have stayed at this chain before and enjoyed my stay (Scottsdale location is stellar!), so I was looking forward to my stay at The DoubleTree by Hilton City Center Philadelphia. Apparently my expectations were too high for even subpar service. Whatever happened to, \"if you're not satisfied with your stay, let us know and we'll make it right?\" So reads the sign in all your guest rooms. I did let you know and you belittled me, embarrassed me, ignored me, locked me out, and then gave me a sack of your cookies on my way out the door. I've had better experiences at hostels! Time to call the Department of Health. BUT FOR sleeping in this bed, at this hotel, I would not have hot welts the size of my hand on my torso and I wouldn't have to burn all my things. Now I am making a scene. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 I'm not one to write reviews (the only other time I've written one was when I had bugs crawling on my table and my legs at another restaurant), but the service that I received at this restaurant was not the best. The food that I had at dinner was okay (pretty good sushi for the price). What wasn't fine was the way that I was treated when I called back the next morning (I'll explain). After leaving the restaurant the night before, I realized that I had accidentally left a large amount of cash on the table (not talking about the $6 cash tip I had also left for my $27 meal) before walking out and wasn't able to go back to retrieve it because I had left the restaurant at closing time. I called them back the next day as soon as they opened up and explained to them what had happened. While a very small part of me was hoping that I'd be able to get my money back, as it was pretty obvious that I had dropped it on the table by accident (I had set aside my cash tip with my receipt, so that extra cash wad was obviously not supposed to be there), I really just wanted them to at least speak nicely to me on the phone. However, I was met with a lot of confusion/disbelief by the man that I was talking to on the phone and eventually told to \"hold on.\" The man went on to have multiple conversations with employees at the restaurant while I was still on the phone (no, I wasn't put on hold). Eventually, he came back on the phone call and told me that he had just asked all of the servers who were there the night before if they had picked up the amount of cash I had lost, but everyone had claimed not to. I nicely told the man on the phone that I had a feeling that my server was not telling the truth and most likely pocketed the money instead of splitting the tips with the rest of the servers (as they do at Crazy Sushi), because I remembered leaving the money on the table. Again, I was met with disbelief and an accusatory tone, then told to hold again. Like last time, I wasn't put on hold, and heard him and a woman screaming back and forth at each other, presumably about me. At that point, I was 100% sure that the man either knew that my server was lying about taking the money or that the money had been split amongst the servers at the end of the night. He eventually came back on the phone to tell me that he asked the servers again (which he couldn't have done since he was yelling the whole time) and they all claimed not to have picked up the money. \n",

      "Long story short, I simply wanted someone to be nice to me on the phone, regardless of the outcome -- it would have been nice to have received a simple apology for the possibility of my server picking up the money and pocketing it, as I knew that the money was probably long gone at that point. However, I was met with a lot of disbelief and an overall unprofessional, rude, and possibly dishonest attitude. \n",

After patronizing the upstairs bar for margaritas and Spanish fries, both of which were underwhelming, we traveled downstairs and sat behind the DJ booth in a semi-private space where a table and chairs were arranged. During this time, a waiter walked through, observed us and continued. Soon after, another man (whom I later learned was the manager) came through the door and the first words out of his mouth were, \"I don't know what you guys are doing back here but you can't be here.\" At the point at which you haven't offered a greeting, or thank you for patronizing, you have made it clear that you don't value your customers.

NOW THEY'RE SAYING MY PRESCRIPTION IS ONLY FOR GLASSES, NOT CONTACTS.  I remember for a fact requesting the prescription to be for both, since I wear both!!!!!  This shouldn't be an all day ordeal.

She didn't give any massage just rubbed some lotion on...thanks I could have done that! The the gel mani... I got a lighter color so I asked for 3 coats ( other techs don't mind) but it seemed like a problem for her she sighed heavy and rolled her eyes. Then when I asked for a design and got up to look at the designs she said \"no bring them over here. Sit down.\" Listen I'm 30 years old don't tell me no and to sit down. I'm not a kid. I picked a design but asked to have some brighter/neon colors which again seemed like a problem. She picked out colors (DARK green,blue &white opposite of what I asked for) so when I asked to see other colors she said \"theses are the only ones\" I then turned around and POINTED to the box filled with other colors!! Finally she went and got it for me. I'm paying for it I want it to look nice to me! When I tipped her she didn't say anything I still tipped her nicely even though I was pissed!

I know my coal was still burning orange and there was still smoke pulling but the man told me they were done. I tried to tell him that we had literally JUST received the extra coals so he decided to shove the top of the hookah in my face saying that it was done, even as I pointed out the fact that it was still burning. After being treated badly all night we decided to leave at this point. We looked at the check and it said $98 without any breakdown of the charges. On top of the hookahs we ordered 2 $2 waters so our check should have been $78, or $83.46 with a 7% sales tax.

Also, the chicken and falafel were both too burnt, and I generally like a little charred flavor. \n",

That didn't stop him from hurling all sorts of accusations at us, demanding to know if we'd purchased the dog \"just because they're pretty\" (my family owned one as I was growing up and we had made a very careful decision to add another BMD to our family) and told us \"it's irresponsible to just go out and buy a dog\" (mind you, my fiancé's mother is a vet in Austria, and my own family bred gun dogs for many years. We asked every question we were supposed to ask and searched for quite awhile before picking a breeder we felt comfortable purchasing a pup from) The vet only stopped criticizing us when my fiancé told him that his mother was a vet, and suddenly his entire demeanor changed.\n",

I was surprised by the reaction, because I've always been under the impression that a new puppy is supposed to go to the vet immediately upon arrival to their new home, sick or not.  They refused to refer me to another vet and told me to wait a month to vet my new pup. I of course ignored this and took her to another vet in the area.\n",

Nobody at the office knew (and mind you, this is the only hospital in the area that can fill out export papers for dogs) that London Heathrow Airport was on a quarantine lockdown and was not accepting animals at the time we were trying to ship our dog.  Perhaps I can't blame Ryan Hospital for this, but I believe that, if you're the only hospital in the area that can do the necessary paperwork, you should be on top of restrictions on animal travel. That's just my two cents. \n",

We decided to leave at this point and went to the front where the manager was to pay for our drinks. One of the people in my party told the manager they never drank their drink. The manager who was equally rude gave us an attitude as we were signing our receipt for all drinks and said what do you expect us to do give it to someone else? We never implied they should give it to another. We were just unsatisfied with the surface and didn't drink anything and wanted to leave.

The arrangement was delivered to the recipient Thursday at 2:30pm. I first seen them yesterday morning (Friday). I was shocked! It was the smallest, ugliest arrangement I have ever seen. My 5 yr old would have put a dandelion display together better than these supposed to be professionals. The pink carnations were rimmed in death brown, the yellow daisy like flowers were wilted and what were supposed to be greens, were ridden with holes and aso brown. \n",

I know my pic on here may say otherwise, but I'm no guy that's gonna slam 2 giant pieces of pizza and go up and try to get more, I'd go home and pass the fuck out. They were swamped so I get it, I've worked in the industry before. When asked if I could simply just get a refund or another order made they refused. I asked to speak with a manager (who apparently is also the cook). He told me he had a lot of people in line to worry about and proceeded to yell at me and how it was my fault. He also said I shouldn't have waited 2 hours to ask about it. Again I'm no mathematician, but it was now a full hour after arguing for 15 min trying to get things right. Him and 2 other people, one who was working the front and another cook proceeded to put their hands on me and tell me to leave. Note: I didn't raise my voice once or put my hands on anyone. Then I had drunk people butting in telling me it's only pizza, yada yada yada. Which it is, not that big of a deal, but it's simply the merit of making sure your customers get what they paid for. I felt like I was at a fraternity. \n",

I can confidently say that this is absolutely one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in my LIFE.  The experience was unsatisfactory from beginning to end and I can honestly say that I have never been so disrespected in my life as a customer.  We sat upstairs and our waitress (some girl who seemed out of it with short, mousy brown hair and an enormous attitude) was rude to begin with, then proceeded to take 10 minutes to bring our drinks and ended up messing up our order.  My sister and I specifically ordered eggplant parmesan, which the waitress must have repeated back to us 4 times.  She then brought us chicken parmesan, and as she handed it to us she said, \"here's your chicken parmesan\" So of course I said, \"this is chicken? I ordered eggplant, remember?\" and she said \"I'm sorry, you're right, it's eggplant\".  As a trusting customer, I took her at her word and began to eat my food, which was in fact CHICKEN! My sister was upset, but could deal.  I on the other hand am a strict vegetarian and have not eaten meat in over 10 years. Until that night. I was furious at this careless waitress and of course did not eat anything.  We then explained to the girl what she had done and asked politely for her to take the chicken parmesan's off our check.  She rudely told us  that we had to wait for her manager, who was at the store.  We waited for 10 minutes and when we couldn't wait any longer due to the fact that we had somewhere else to be and were already running late because of her mistake, we said \"can you please just fix this and explain to your manager later?\".  At this point, the waitress and another waitress who was standing with her became extremely inappropriate, telling us they won't help us, it's our problem, and leave if we can't wait.  This type of shocking exchange continued until the manager finally showed up a few minutes later.  He was just as rude, telling us \"fine, what do you want me to do, take the chicken parms off your bill? Fine then.\"  As he was bombarding us with HIS rudeness, his two waitresses were standing behind him, staring us down and mouthing at my mother and sister and I the word \"b****\" over and over again! Obviously we were completely shocked and when we told him what they were doing, he DENIED that they would do that and said we were out of line for suggesting such a thing! He then proceeded to say to my sister and mother and I, \"ladies, leave this to the men to handle (my father was there as well), you are obviously incapable of dealing\".  There was no getting through to these exceptionally RUDE individuals.  I will write a negative review on every single website I can and I will call the local newspapers, and Better Business Bureau, etc.  If I could give this place negative stars I would.  Their staff is disrespectful, they are insolent and no one in their right mind should support them. Hey, at least they stay true to their name.  Rotten Ralph's is indeed employing ROTTEN employees, making for quite the ROTTEN experience. \n",

My one word of warning is this place attracts the most misbehaved kids you have ever seen, we were once sitting in the loft-like second level of booths and had a screaming child who demanded grilled cheese and her father said he would get it for her, even though its not on the weekend brunch menu. He was rude to our waitress after she politely told him that the cooking stations that would normally be used for grilled cheese were being used for another brunch dish, and the father demanded the manager come up.  He then told the manager that if he wanted lobster, the manager was going to go get him lobster.  Turns out, if you're rude to the manager at Jones, you don't get lobster.  Your obnoxious daughter just gets a waffle with fruit.  The best part is that \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was playing in the speakers. \n",

Your employees are rude, you have to be a mind reader to figure out the line system and they clearly think the plastic gloves are there to protect them from the food and not you from them.  I even wrote Cosi stating the above.  The GetCosi.com site responded immediately and said someone would be in touch.  No one was in touch.  I sent another email after another piss poor experience and then got a response.  Apparently the General Manager doesn't seem to think there is a problem.

The guy had half his hair dyed red and the other half dyed purple. He wasn't welcoming at all! I stood around for over 5 minutes without even being acknowledged. He seemed kind of bothered that he had customers. I asked him if he had any jewelry that would fit into my $40 budget to which he snapped \"No, you'd pay $40 for the service alone and the jewelry starts at $20\" I didn't mind the response, what I did mind was the snide attitude he had and the tone in which he told me this. I was a paying customer and he made me feel as if his time was too precious for me. Months ago I came here to buy a barbell for my tongue piercing and the piercer that helped me that time was a little nicer. I think he was a little on the heavier side and was a red head. He asked me where I got my tongue pierced and I said Zebra. He said Zebra had the really good quality jewelry and recommended that I buy jewelry from Zebra and that he'd pierce me with it should I want more piercings in the future. Now that I think about it, I find it weird that they charge such an absurd price for a nose piercing! The guy said it himself, Zebra has better Jewelry (and customer service from what I can tell) so why would they charge more than them?! Who do they think they are? Anyway I went to Energy Tattoo across the street today and got my piercing. The service there was so much better! The piercer was extremely nice and professional and welcoming. And Energy Tattoo only charges $45! I would definitely recommend checking out Energy tattoo for your piercing needs. They're nicer and cheaper. And I love my new piercing. \n",

She said ok and left. Then some girl who looked barely 18 walked up and asked what the problem was. I let her know about the burgers and she had the nerve to tell me that \"next time I come in and noticed this BEFORE MY MEAL WAS FINISHED she would be able to help me\". I let her know that my meal was only half way eaten and that I had just noticed it. I also let her know that I was not trying to get her to comp my meal and she said she understood and was not there for that reason. ? Really- you call yourself a manager? I worked in restaurants from 16 to 26 and would have never treated a customer that way. I paid the bill , left a 20% tip FOR the waitress and left.

Finally ordered and the food was old.  Chicken teriyaki lunch special tasted like it was cooked hours ago and just got heated up.  Other ingredients didn't taste fresh as well. \n",

Last Saturday we were there with at least 15 people celebrating a friend that's moving away. We were all having a good time and my two friends decided to jump on the stage and dance around. I get that one of them hanging from the ceiling was not okay, and I get escorting them down, but this security guy Vic was EXTREMELY rude. He aggressively pulled them down and basically dragged them out by the arm no warning, no chances to grab their stuff, no chill. I ran after him and tried to talk to him and he disregarded me like a dog begging for food. I felt so disrespected. The worst part was that they didn't let me back in to get my bag...are you serious? The club looked more stupid having us yell to our friends that were still inside for our stuff. So heated. So upset. This makes me not want to ever want to step foot inside O'Malleys again. So unfortunate (for them). \n",

      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 Worst place ever. I order some tacos and my husband order some muscles calamari and more. The food was take out. And once we get home I saw the tacos it only had one shirmp per taco. I reach to the manager. Who was extreanly rude. I reach to the general manager. Its been 1 month and nothing.  I am a manager for a local hotel on State Street. I will not recommend this restaurant to any of my guest. \n",

I then turned in the wrong bowl and she gave us the rudest attitude like it was our fault! I then said okay well here is the other bowl that we didn't touch at all, and she rolled her eyes and I still said thank you and she turned her back and ignored me. The customer next to me even looked at her in discuss with her nasty attitude! \n",

The server was rude; no friendly greeting, just a rushed \" have you decided?\" And when we said we needed a minute, we were ignored until the next \"are you ready?\" My dinner came to the table incomplete and cold. Not just a little cold; stone cold, butter congealed cold. I told the young man who brought it to the table that it was incomplete and he left to get the missing parts. But we had to flag the waitress down to tell her it was cold. She just looked at me and said \"okay I'll bring you a side of...\" I told her to take the whole plate and bring the whole thing back hot. I was not even upset, just kind of shocked. \n",

      "We checked into our room during that heat wave (mid-May).  The upstairs unit we had reserved was over 100 degrees inside the room.  There was no air conditioner and the heat was unbearable, especially since it was upstairs, sun beating in, and no ventilation.\n",
      "The girl at the front was very nice and tried her best to cool off our room with old fans, but it didn't really help.\n",
      "I found a room across the street at the Best Western for $40.00 less and it had air.  When I approached the girl at the front regarding the possibility of us moving, she said she didn't think the manager would let us out of our reservation.  We had only been in the room for 20-30 minutes max.\n",
      "I was surprised by her reaction to letting us leave, since the room was really not suitable for anyone.    \n",
      "So I asked her to please call the manager and said that I would talk to him personally.    She called and he told her that he would not talk to me, but if we left he would charge my card for the night's rent. ($210.00).  WHAT?!?!\n",
      "We stayed because I could not afford to pay for both rooms, but what a horrible experience.  I felt like we were being held hostage.   We were all unable to sleep in the HOT room!  We had all the windows open which made it very noisy.  And some of the screens were ripped, which let in bugs.  It was really awful.\n",
      "I spoke to the manager the next morning when he came to work and told him how disappointed I was that he would not let us leave.  Not only did he not apologize but  he was rude, flippant,  and condescending.  He just kept repeating, \"You want me to lose the revenue from your room?\"  Really?  \n",
      "I tried to explain to him that he was not seeing the bigger picture.  The $210.00 he was so worried about losing was nothing compared to the loss of future revenue from us, friends and family members that used to frequent their motel.\n",
      "Very disappointing..... \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Please never shop here. Ya the clothes are cute but the quality is shit. Trust me. It is worse than forever 21 and they charge you $100 for a plain white shirt that is going to fall apart in a day. I bought a pair of heels from this LF in Santa Barbara last week for $200 for a prom. I felt so guilty about spending that kind of money but I knew I would get good use out of them so did it. During my night at prom I was literally walking in grass and the strap broke off. Since I had been wearing them the whole night they had a little bit of scruff on the top but regardless a pair of $200 shoes shouldn't just break that easily. When I went to get my money back or at least exchange them the workers were very rude and unprofessional and said they were \"too beat up.\" Ya! Maybe because the strap is ripped off! $200 in the drain. My friends used to shop here and I used to shop here a lot as well but I can assure you that myself and anybody I know will not step foot in this place ever again. \n",

      ">>> 5.0 So I have to say I was definitely expecting the worst when I came for the end of season sale. I'm not \"white\" fyi, as most people reviewing are saying that the girls that work here treat white girls better. After shopping around for a few minutes I was offered a fitting room by a girl named Amber who was AMAZING. She helped me find everything I needed in every size and was literally on the hunt for the things I was looking for the whole time I was in the store. She was super sweet and genuine. I was also helped by Sam who got me a pair of Jeffrey Campbells for $60.  Working in retail makes me super critical about customer service, but every girl that approached me made me feel like she personally knew me. Yes, the store is messy and it drove me a little crazy. But the sales associates were all super helpful and nice! I would recommend this store to anyone. However, I wouldn't recommend this store to anyone who thinks they're too good to interact with sales associates (as in assuming the people who where rude in their reviews about LF are). \n",

Jamison working with my sister and I on our idea being helpful and honest about what's best and the tattoo can't be so small etc. while Jamison is helping us and leading through us being tattooed, Ken Knox (another artist) constantly chiming in dissing our tattoos and refusing to tattoo one of us to finish up faster because He would \"NEVER do tattoo smaller than ones hand or less than $200\". My sister and I were both very uncomfortable and disgusted by how rude and arrogant he was towards us. We both left with our blood boiling..  And the funniest part is my first visit for my tattoo outline done by Jamison and Ken Knox did an even smaller tattoo on one of my friends. But he's \"NEVER do one smaller than ones hand or less than $200\".  All in all, that's no way to treat a customer.\n",

      "There are no real tables unless you sit outside, you sit on a counter where they do most of the cooking or a ledge by the window. Outside has patio seating.\n",
      "\n",
      " My boyfriend and I started with the oyster shooters and the fried scallop and fried oyster plate. Loved both. They use Japanese Panko crumbs instead of batter which is a big plus. Then we decided to splurge and share the Full size lobster! Absolutely delish! Grilled Lobster to be exact... succulent and cooked to perfection and worth every penny! ($39). It's served with a large cup of bisque (lobster or chowder), we had the scrumptious lobster bisque, and also served with a creamy pineapple coleslaw and a few onion rings. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a great experience with the service. I guess we just got lucky. The place gets pretty hectic and people get impatient so they tend to be rude, which then makes the staff defensive. Can't blame them. Always be nice to restaurant staff and they'll be nice to you! Simple...\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short... the food is great. Great portions. A little pricey, but hey... it's friggen beautiful Santa Barbara, it's expected. Worth it.... BUT, still cheaper than Moby Dick Sea Food which is next door... horrible, no flavor, over cooked food and more expensive!!! I digress.....\n",
      "\n",
      "Only gave 4 stars because the place is a bit visually dirty inside and out. They definitely need to \"clean\" the place up a bit. I like rustic charm and all but not splattered lobster and crab juice on walls and windows. Also, Can barely see out of the windows because they're so dirty, which was a shame since I was facing the ocean and it would have been a glorious view. \n",

      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 The most unfriendly club in the world. I lost my credit card there and they would not let me back in to get it. The staff was very rude. I had only one drink and was not drunk. Then to get your credit card you have to leave a message on their automated machine you do not talk to anyone in person. The worse club in santa barbara don't waste your money or time. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Let me start by saying if I could give this store negative 5 stars, I would. My Father recently passed away and is the owner of the Verizon account we have. After some hassle an employee named Julie was able to get me my upgrade to an iPhone 6s and I also ordered a screen cover and case. I didn't appreciate the tacky up sell move for the accessory bundle that came with extra crap you don't actually need.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was too bad that my phone was on back order. However, I'm pretty patient, so I didn't mind having to wait to have it shipped to my apartment address. At this point I was going to write Julie a great review for being able to get me a phone despite the difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's extremely unfortunate that Julie is incredibly incompetent and can't enter in a proper address or email for a signature required delivery. I tried calling the store a couple days later to see where my order confirmation was so I could track my order. I called several times with no answer until the evening and had to leave a message for Julie who told me she couldn't email me a receipt. No surprise there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually I called the national support line, who told me it was sent to my mother on our account. She forwarded it to me. This is when I realized Julie had entered my shipping address incorrectly. Unfortunately, she couldn't fix that either and she did not return my call to tell me how she would help to resolve it either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Julie clearly doesn't care about her customer service or owning up to or correcting her mistakes, I spent 3 days making phone calls to FedEx and I finally was able to get my phone after a huge headache of dealing with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then, I took my new phone and case with cover to the store so I could activate it and have the accessories put on. Of course, Julie has to help me again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Irritated, I let her activate everything while she continues to not apologize for any inconvenience she caused for her mistakes when I tell her it was a hassle to get my phone--after she asked about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, their internet sucks and my iCloud doesn't want to transfer all of my apps, contacts, etc. So after wasting a bunch of time, I leave with most of my contacts on my phone and a screen cover and case placed by Julie herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well about an hour later, I notice a crack in my case and the cover falls off. Furious, I go back the next day. I'm rudely turned away by some man at the door. I then call the national customer service line to explain the situation who tells me they're very sorry that I'm dealing with this terrible experience and I shouldn't be treated this way by a Verizon store. Unfortunately, the national customer service line can't issue me new accessories because my Father is deceased and he is the owner of the account. They told me at this time, I should immediately request to speak to the manager at the store and demand replacements.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went back in and waited patiently for a manager. Over a half hour later, a blonde girl who works there tells me I can't speak with the manager and tells me she's sorry but they try to offer the best service they can and they can't do anything more for me. She also told me I can get a new screen cover because it has a warranty and it's absolutely free. Guess what lady, no it's not, I actually checked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so disgusted I left as quickly as possible. DO NOT waste your time with this store! Verizon needs to learn that there is a HUGE difference between \"trying\" to offer great customer service and actually doing so!\n",
      "\n",
      "Go to the Apple Store where they actually resolve customer service issues and are trained properly to do their jobs. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 3.0 Overall I would give it a 3.5 star. The food is good but the service is bad. The bar tender has zero personality and was kinda rude when he sat us in the restaurant. After sitting down, it took about 10 min to get anything to drink. The food was pretty good but they forgot to bring part of the order so that kinda sucked. I don't think I would go there again unless I absolutely had to. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 4.0 If you could go to one tasting place in Santa Barbara, I'd recommend this one!  Although I love Kalyra wines, I think this place is fun because they have so much of a variety, with wine and beer flights.  They have a traditional beer tastings, as well as fruit beers.  You can apply the flight price to your wine/beer purchase, which is always a plus.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The only reason I give this place four stars instead of five, is because the staff weren't the friendliest.  Not rude, but not nice and welcoming either.  But I've only been here once, so maybe next time my experience with the staff would be different. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 This is the worst antique store I have ever been to in my life! The owner kicked us out bcuz we were just browsing. How are you supposed to know if you would like to buy something if you can't see what they have! Every antique store is different and offers a variety of things. He said they were too busy to just have browsers. Busy my foot! There was no one else in the store, and no wonder! Do not even waste your time with this guy or his stuffy store. \n",

I walked over excited to get my rolls and the guy in the front rudely said \"CLOSED\" as I opened the door. Then said \"9:30 is the summer hours and it's not changing!\" Idk who the guy was. Never seen him before and I've come there quite often with my boyfriend..\n",

      ">>> 1.0 I came to Sears Auto Center in Santa Barbara to buy a new battery and have it installed. My car requires that power be maintained to the computer during the battery change, or else the computer resets. I called Sears and asked if they have the equipment (Memory Settings Saver) and was told that they do. I came and left my car for the battery change, and confirmed multiple times with the advisor that power will be maintained to the computer during the battery change.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came to pick up my car, I was surprised to notice that my automatic keys no longer opened my car (both sets of keys). I asked the tech if he kept the power to the computer during the battery change, and he said no because he was not told to do so. I asked the advisor if he told the tech to keep power to computer, and he admitted that he forgot to tell him. This was an annoyance because I had to go to my car's dealership the next day to have the computer reset, but mistakes happen and the advisor was apologetic, respectful, and admitted to forgetting to inform the tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when I asked to speak to the manager, I was appalled as I had never received such awful service anywhere, ever. When I asked if I still had to pay the $20 service fee even though the service ended up causing me more problems than I came in with, he told me yes with a smirk and walked away from me. I asked him for the name of the advisor that forgot to tell the information, or the name of the tech, and again he rudely told me \"no,\" walked away from me with no explanation and ignored me completely. He told me there is nothing he can do and disappeared into the back room. \n",

      "I have never written a review for any business before, as it takes a lot for me to feel that service is bad. However, this horrible experience compelled me to make a Yelp account and write this review in order to save other hard-working customers wasted  money and wasted time taken off work to go to their car dealership to correct Sears' mistake. Most of all, I don't want other customers to have to be treated with such disrespect and contempt.\n",

When I went to pick up the shoes a couple of weeks later, they couldn't find my $400 pair of Allan Edmonds. They said they couldn't locate the shoes without the receipt, which i forgot to bring with me. When I did come back about three weeks later with the receipt, they still couldn't find them and said they had probably given them away to \"charity.\" Wow, avoid this place at all costs. If I could rate them a \"zero\", I would. \n",

We arrived, famished, about half an hour before closing, figuring we'd just get our order as take-out because it was so late. Well, instead of telling us that they were not taking any more orders (which we would have been totally fine with), the waiters just completely ignored us. Literally. We could not get anyone to talk to us, even though all three of the waiters we saw very clearly saw us before retreating into the kitchen to hide. After waiting over 15 minutes, we gave up and left. We ended up going to China Pavilion because it was the first restaurant we came across that was open. We got there right before their closing time, but the waitress there was really nice and straight-off told us we'd have to get take-out because it was almost closing time (which was totally fine with us!), and even gave us hot tea while we waited.\n",

      "It's too bad that that happened, because I'd been going to Meun Fan pretty regularly before then, but couldn't bring myself to go back there for a long time after it did. I've been back once since that time, and the service was ok, but I can't really bring myself to be as enthusiastic about the place as I used to be. Nonetheless, I'm giving them 4/5 stars, because they do have the best Thai food I've had in SB, and my experience with them other than that one time has generally been good. \n",

JUST TRANSFER ME TO ANOTHER PERSON!!! OR you could've offered to redirect me to someone else so you can go to your appointment! I donated and also have a membership to go to this clinic!!! Seriously made me instantly annoyed that this lady was so ballsy to be so rude and just try cut me off. Couldn't even answer my questions or even ask me if i was a member. She made things a whole lot more complicated with not being able to get the flea meds i wanted. \n",

So when we got our food and explained that wasn't what we ordered he shrugged his shoulders and said \"well you don't have a receipt so I can't check\" then refused to give us lemons on top of everything! Very rude employees and food was terrible quality! The pasta (that I didn't order but ended up with) didn't have any sauce on it, it was just noodles with tomatoes and 2 pieces of shrimp!

He insisted that we need to order everything and he will not take the main course order after the starters. He said that he can't just focus on our table. We decided not to order and left. \n",

Pizza is horrible and Assistant \"manager\" Jeanette was very unprofessional, disrespectful, rude and not wanting to fix the issue with the pizza I paid for.

      ">>> 1.0 Note: This review is based strictly on service. Rude rude rude. This place needs a major AA (Attitude Adjustment). I wish the staff members had nametags so I could single out the two people that were so rude to me and my new fiancé the day after we were engaged. As we arrived we were greeted with an expression and comment that made me sick. The waitress looked up at me and questioned us sitting down to wait for my parents.. She gave me a rude look and sharply told me that if I wanted breakfast it wasn't available. Then my fiancé attempted to order from the cashier inside and the man behind the counter without any words spoken through his arm with his thumb out pointing to the other register. I had enough and we walked out (wasting $4 in parking). We are now at another place and loving it.. Note to the owner/manager. If you're trying to save money by hiring cheap labor you're making a mistake. Sometimes cheap wages can make an employee unhappy and in turn they treat customers poorly in turn driving away business. I hope you get that point. \n",

I took them in specifically for DRY CLEANING, and when we picked them up found out they had been LAUNDERED (meaning washed in a washing machine and PRESSED hot while still wet to dry them!) When I expressed my surprise and anger the lady working there informed me that that is how they the clean ALL DRESS SHIRTS, regardless. These shirts are marked DRY CLEAN ONLY. Now the collars and cuffs are frayed and heat damaged, they didn't even take out the collar stays so there is a permanent imprint in the fabric! The owner is rude and crass, the service is cheap (though not in price!) and low class, never going back. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Do not come here if there are more than 4 people in your party and you want to eat outside.  They do not take reservations and the staff cannot judge how long a wait will be. We were told 25-30 minutes. Talked to the waitress after 25 minutes and she rudely said it'll be another 20 minutes. Meanwhile people in smaller parties kept getting seated. Some of them in larger tables.  Food here not worth the hassle. \n",

The sushi chef was beyond rude.. and when I reminded him about our order (which he had forgotten about) he rolled his eyes and gave us a really bad fishy tuna. THEN.. we drove home and literally 15 minutes later we both got sick. REALLY SICK. This was a horrible experience. We are both SB locals and are always open to trying new places. Unfortunately, I will NEVER return to this place. It definitely DOES NOT deserve a place on State St. I hope no one else gets as sick as we did. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 I am giving them one star for being rude. I ordered a cappuccino, and sat down at a  two person table to work. After about 2 hours, a staff member came up to me and asks if I want to order something. I told him already did. He said, \"There are two girls here looking for a seat.\" I look around, and the place is only about two-thirds full, and there are empty seats all along the windows and the wall behind me. Both to my right and left are tables occupied even longer than mine and by people on their own... so I guess for some reason I was singled out. I have been going to the State Street location a couple of times a week for about a year, and whenever I have friends visit I usually take them to get coffee at the French Press. Definitely won't be giving the French Press my business any more! Handlebar's is just as good, and the staff are much nicer. \n",

Then tell us the other 2 weren't dressed appropriately ( which they were they look so nice a button up long sleeve and a pair of tight jeans they said they were too baggy and too long had an excuse for everything) so I ditched this lame stinky place that smelled like sweat and piss when we walked in and went to the Wildcat and had a blast I'm not a big club person but if I ever was this would never be a place I would ever visit again the door boys lol are so rude and the manager owner whatever he is is even worse this place will be going out of business soon or getting new owners maybe then I will return?!?!  I used to work in the club scene doing bottle service like I said I'm from LA this is nowhere near a club definitely just rude people at the front thinking that they can disrespect and talk down to other people lost our business.. Dropped a lot of money that night at Wildcat \n",

Don't waste your money, save your shoes and your time.\n",

      ">>> 1.0 O'Malleys is probably the worst place in this area. The bouncers were beyond rude and degrading when they decided not to accept the IDs of 8 girls all over the age of 23 and when we politely asked as to why they were condescending (to put it nicely). The bouncers also failed to intervene when one of the girls in our group was groped by a stranger in front of the establishment and strangers stepped up to help. This is a place that promotes disrespect, sexual harassment, and enjoys the company of patrons that are demeaning to fellow customers. We are from out of town and during an otherwise good, fun night, the second we got to the door at O'Malleys, we felt threatened and insecure without any explanation of why we deserved such treatment. There are better bars right across the street or around the corner who have stand-up employees that did step up to help us, who did treat us with respect, and who we respected in return. Don't waste your money here. \n",

The employee who helped me didn't wash her hands after I noticed that she took money she went to go in the back of the kitchen and you can see her preparing food. Not a fan of this pizza place. I highly suggest you go to papa johns or rusty's pizza which the customer service and food you know will taste better! \n",

We recently came in for breakfast while visiting SB and asked to not have onions on the special - I understand no substitutions to specials - I only asked if I could get it without onions - maybe they are sprinkled on top - I don't know - instead of the girl at the counter explaining to me whether the onions are cooked in or not she just rudely said \"nope\" when I asked if she could explain, she said \" no changes to specials, chef's rules\" without even asking the chef. Whenever we drive through or stay over in SB, we always come here - here's the things that aren't good:\n",

Always admired how pretty she was. Didn't realize the coldness that came out of her. I came here for a few coffees for my coworkers across the street they all had pretty serious requests so I asked the girl if she knew anything close or similar she literally just flat out said \"no\". Wasn't helpful at all then asked me to step aside so she could assist the person behind me. The person behind seemed to be her friend because her attitude went from like a wall to this cheery talkative thing. Then I had to stand there for about 5 minutes waiting for them to finish. Once I ordered she went back to being rude and lacking hospitality. Ive been in here multiple times. They make you feel like you aren't hip enough to come to their establishment. Which sucks because I've NEVER felt so shut out in a establishment. I've only wrote about 3 yelp reviews in my life but this one had to be done. I chose to remain anon because we have mutual friends. But something needs to change here. The staff, the bitter ass coffee that always tastes watered down, only thing good about it are the pastries. And they don't even make them. Drop your stigmas. Treat everyone with respect. This isn't the first or even the 10th REVIEW pointing out similar problems. Change or tank. Tell your gf she needs to work on her attitude at the counter at least while she's working. It's losing you business. \n",

Picked them up and A) the repair work was messy (glue showing where sole \"repaired,\" and sole still not fully attached as asked, B) they damaged the shoe--the toe was dented inward as if something heavy had been pressing on it, and C) the clerk claimed the shoe had come in with that dent, and I know it didn't. She insisted that she'd seen it and \"was going to call me about it.\" She didn't so that assertion means nothing. Damage, shoddy work, rudeness, and lying--a place to avoid for sure \n",

They lost my shoes and called me four years later and told me I had to pick them up or they were going to throw them away.  Then I came to pick them up and they tried to charge me for the repairs.  You can't charge people for something that you have lost for four years. It's unethical. Not to mention the people that work there are rude and the repairs they did looked as though it had been done by someone without even the most rudimentary knowledge of sewing.  I could have done it better myself and it wouldn't have taken four years.  I have no idea how these people even got started in shoe repair let alone how they have stayed in business.  DO NOT GO THERE!!! \n",

If you dont have more then three people in your party ordering tepanyaki, just sit at the bar, the chef won't come to your table unless he feels its \"worth his time\" (at least thats how our oh so polite server phrased it). The last time i checked restaurants are for the pleasure of the consumer.  I will admit that im sure that their cooks work hard and take pride in their skills and are very good at what they do, but there is no excuse for telling customers that the chef doesn't give a rats ass about you. :-P \n",

I had the tiger prawns with pasta in a saffron mushroom creme sauce and my husband got their antelope steak special, garlic mashed and veggies.  Both came with soup (pistachio corn chowder - yum) and homemade bread (double yum).  We also tried the stuffed mushrooms and the broth was really good.  Soaked up that broth with the bread.\n",

The bartender gave us a menu and then asked for ID. I am not from the US, so I only had my international DL with me. The girl said they wouldn't accept this since she doesn't know how it looks like and that maybe it's a fake one. I said -sorry I don't bring my passport since I'm afraid to lose it. She said -sorry, I can't accept it. I was trying to negotiate with her and said there is no reason for me to lie etc. Eventually she said- well if you don't like something just go somewhere else.

She didnt give me any advice on how to resolve the issue after my one session with her.  She was rude and didnt like any questions regarding acupuncture.

We were in a slight rush so I kindly asked the waiter if he can put a rush on our food because we had to catch a train. I specified that we only had about 35 min to 40 min time to eat and leave to catch the train. I ordered their rigatoni with meat sauce but requested pink sauce instead. The pink sauce is made with vodka, but you are not supposed to taste the vodka. Also, there was no other customers there, we were the only ones at the restaurant at this time, because it was around 5 pm, before dinner time, meaning they were not busy at all. When they brought my food and after a few bites, I noticed that I am basically drinking the vodka. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said I quote \"Well you wanted it fast, right?\" ummm. Does this mean you will then offer me less quality food? If you knew this was a possibility then why didn't you warn me? So I spoke to the manager and all he offered was to throw my pasta back in the pot. lol yeah like that sounds really appetizing, after I already added tons of cheese and spices, and sauces etc. so it turned out not that great at the end but then by the time they brought out my food, we had to leave, and I left with a tummy ache.

We sat in the bar area at a high top. Meanwhile, the waiter who seemed to be the usual server, we'll call him \"S\", was also helping us alongside Trevor. Friend ordered a martini, I a glass of red. Trevor offered wine that wasn't on their list - twice - based on what I was looking for. My friend's second drink was the second wine he presented after I finished my first glass.\n",

The bill arrived probably around 9:30-9:35. We ignored it because we were talking. Friend eventually asked S about desserts (despite bill arriving earlier), since again we were not offered any after finishing our meal. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD. The server reacted as if he was surprised. He pulled his phone out of his pocket to look at the time (9:45). First mistake. Then he said a bit apprehensively that it looked like we still had time - because you know, the kitchen closes at 10:00. Second mistake. WTF? My friend and I were appalled at how rude and short sighted he was in, well, his service.

Besides, they close at 5 PM and it is too early for working people like me. I will never return. \n",

      ">>> 2.0 I was contemplating whether my boyfriend and I should go with this hotel or one on main street. The only reason we picked this one was because the other one didn't have \"official parking\", so that was going to be a hassle to deal with. Boy, am I regretting my decision right now. This overpriced hotel does not include breakfast. I was disappointed but said, alright, I guess we'll try the restaurant here at the hotel, which turns out charges $10 for a waffle (just the waffle, not a combo) and $3 for a piece of toast (wait, what?) Let me run across the street to Vons and buy a whole bread for $5, you can keep your $3 piece of toast. \n",

      "That wasn't the worst part of our stay.The NOISE was! Which is the main reason I decided to write this review. First morning we spent at this hotel, I was rudely awakened before 7am by family next door who happened to bring their loud children with them. I felt like they were in our room, it was so loud. We were here on vacation and one of the things I personally wanted to do on MY well deserved vacation was to be able to sleep in. We drove long hours and spend good money to spend time at this hotel, don't think I'm wrong in expecting peace and quiet. The family checked out, so it was suddenly nice and quiet. Or so I thought. Few hours later, what sounded like loud college girls checked in (for spring break I assume) and the yelling and screaming once again begins. Blow dryer going, door slamming left and right, and etc. It went on all night long. As I'm in the middle of writing this review, my boyfriend says, \"You should say that we stayed on the first floor of a large hotel on the strip in Vegas and had an experience with less noise.\" So, here you go. The noise here is pretty darn ridiculous. And it's not like it's a cheap hotel to have such a shitty experience. I've never been this excited to check out of a hotel and never return. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 I'd give this place zero stars if I could. I should have read the Yelp reviews before going in. I'd gone once before and had a negative experience but really needed a quick manicure.  When I arrived an irrate client was yelling at the manager about something or other. Now i know who to believe. I should have walked out right then. When I sat down to get my manicure, the young male manicurist barley acknowledged me. And since I saw everyone else was getting a bottle of small, cheap Costco water, I asked for one and my manicurist seemed very put out and begrudgingly grabbed me one.  When he removed my polish he smeared the old color all over my fingers which got into the cracks of my knuckles -- never seen anything so sloppy. When I politely asked if he was going to get the smears off he became irate and told me HE WAS NOT FINISHED YET. I told him there was no reason to yell and he said I AM NOT YELLING; there was absoulte rage on his face, I mean scary rage.  I told him I didn't like being spoken to that way and would be leaving and got up to go.  With the same horrible expression he yelled further that I owed them $1 for the water which i had taken one sip of, I thought that was pretty funny actually, i mean how unbelievably petty.  On my way out I told the manager that she had a big problem on her hands with the angry male manicurist who was unbelievably rude. She said nothing, didn't make any attempt to apologize -- didn't seem to care in the least. I will make a point to tell everyone I know to avoid this salon at all costs. And having grown up in SB, there are plenty of people to tell.  There is no reason to be so mean and nasty to nice patrons who just want to get their nails done in peace. I was blown away to read all the negative Yelp reviews. Was the most unpleasant salon experience I've ever had -- truly AWFUL. I wish I could report to the better business bureau, in fact, I am going to try. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 We have been coming to Meun Fan for 5 years. I am not sure if the ownership has changed recently or if I have never met the owner before but I had a very unpleasant interaction with him last week. He was extremely rude and agitated, not only to myself but also to the staff. It was enough to make us not want to go back. It is too bad because everyone else that works there is very friendly and helpful, and the food is great. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 I too came here for the Axxess card deal which is pretty sweet at 20% off everytime. Man, now I know why. First off, how are you going to go into a nail salon that smells like old dirty feet, but I sprayed some of my purse febreeze around me and it didn't bother me much after that. I also think it is rude for someone who is doing nails to be on her cell phone, I definitely would have been pissed if it was me getting a mani. I went in for a spa pedi. I was in and out within an hour, but the lady who did me gave me NO massage. I have been getting pedis every 3-4 weeks religiously for YEARS and for me to not get a massage for a 40$ pedi, pshhhh I will def take my business elsewhere. I also hated that the water was less than hot, the whole experience was terrible but I only went here for the Axxess deal and because it was the 4th of July and I was off work and wanted to get a pedi in on my day off. never again! \n",

      ">>> 1.0 We tried to get a bottle of champgane because we were with a bachelorette party and they refused to serve us because we didn't buy a table. The server was rude to us and couldn't imagine why we would want some champagne when we didn't pay money to sit at a table. After much convincing we got the champagne for our bachelorette, but the overall feel was pretentious and snobby. I don't think I would head here again. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 I've only been to Something's Fishy twice and I will never return again. I have no complaints about the food, but their service leaves a lot to be desired. Both times I've been there the Teppanyaki chef was rude, quiet, and not entertaining in the least bit. He did not engage or do anything special and the servers are even ruder. The first time it took over 45 minutes to receive the check and it was incorrect. The second time I ate there, the chef spilled VERY hot tea all over our table and me. No one offered an apology or even a napkin, not the chef, manager, or server. In fact, the server walked over and placed my salad in the water and just walked away. My friend had to get up and ask for some napkins and a towel. NO ONE cared and trust me, not only was it a mess, but scolding hot tea, does not feel particularly good in your lap. This restaurant has great potential, but they need better training on customer service and just basic etiquette. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Shawn was our driver and from the get go had poor customer service. He was short and condescending. At one point he even called our group of 8 not classy. He also clapped at us like dogs to tell us it was time to go (I don't even clap at my dog). Sandwiches were sub par. And there was so much information! It was hard to relax and take in the scenery or enjoy your friends because Everytime you started to enjoy yourself he pulled the group to explain one thing or another. The first winery was all about talking about wine process and how to drink which is fine, but then here Shawn comes and pulls us out not even giving us time to purchase or sample any other wines like the owner said we could after his demonstration. I've been on several wine tours with different companies in different wine regions. This by far was the most rude and rushed tour guide I've met. I mean even when I kindly pointed out that he offended my group by his classy comment and clapping at us, he didn't once apologize. He even told one of my friend to \"read\" when she asked him to point out which side the roast beef sandwiches were on. I paid good money for this tour and to be treated in such a way was unprofessional and in bad taste. I would not recommend this place. \n",

      ">>> 4.0 Came here with our Vegan granddaughter. Vegan or not these are really yummy!  It was pretty busy & the seating is limited. The only negative ( not fault of the business) was a couple of very rude guys who were sitting at a table for four & oblivious that people were waiting for a place to sit. They had finished their bowls. They both had dogs-one that they let lick & slime the table. They did not seem to notice their chairs almost prevented people trying to dit st the bar area next to them. Rude, thoughtless people made this less than a great experience!!! \n",

      ">>> 1.0 I am in the hospital and wanted chinese food delivered. First thing I asked was if they would deliver to a hospital. I explained that the driver would need to come up to the room since no one was available to meet them downstairs. The driver left the food with a random guy whom she claims was a security guard. She put him on the phone  to verify I ordered chinese food and left. My order was placed at 7:45 but the driver did not show up until 9pm. When I called to talk to the manager about not getting my food he got defensive and said since I talked to the guy on the phone it was out of their hands. I tried to remind him I CLEARLY STATED the food needed to be delivered to my room before the order was placed. He refused to listen and was very rude and would not do anything to rectify the situation. Poor customer service. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Uncomfortable experience, super rude staff. We made the mistake of walking in at 12:05 (they're supposed to be open at 12) and we moved 'the gate' to the side to get in. (A giant iron door that isn't attached to a wall...) Fine, our mistake, but they could have been a lot more polite with how they handled the misunderstanding. Won't be returning here again. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 This place was amazing prior to the ownership change and redevelopment. This is nothing like the previous farmer boys and should be avoided. To start off, The waitress was extremely rude, maybe she was hungover or angry about something else but it shouldn't be placed on the customers. The menu is extremely scaled back for a breakfast place with limited options to choose and even fewer beverages. Orange juice water coffee soda. No apple juice none of the blueberry tea or pomegranate drink the previous farmer boys had. In addition the food was brought out incomplete without the hshbrowns and the toast was burnt. I mentioned this to the waitress and she laughed and said I should have ordered what my friend got. \n",
      "All and all this place is a disappointment other than the new chairs and countertop the decorations inside are tacky and loses any authentic feel. It's a shame to see a place which such character be changed to something rather dull and unappealing. Save yourself go elsewhere \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Would give zero stars if possible... I use to go here all the time almost every two weeks and then went in today... They did an awful job didn't speak or acknowledge me the entire time and talked/texted on the phone the entire time....They also change the price depending on who it is... Every time it's somehow different. The reason I will never come back is that I noticed they don't wash their nail kits... They just reuse which is disgusting and not sanitary. They also have a card in which if you come 6 times you get a free manicure....turns out they don't actually acknowledge that and just make up excuses for why they can't use it. Overall very dirty, rude, and unprofessional nail salon. Very disappointed. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Last minute need for pedicure, walking by, went in.  Totally rude employees, dirty, I should have left then, but was in dire need of a pedicure.  The guy was so rough cutting my cuticles I was doing everything to not yell or cry for that matter and then he cut me and realized it so dabbed cotton with polish remover and stuck it on the cut!  Hate to be cliche, but wish I could give it less than one star.  Stay away. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Don't bother with this store.  The owner makes you feel like a criminal the moment you step in.  He is rude and obnoxious. There are surveillance cameras everywhere and posted signs \"Do not touch\".  Overpriced.  There are two other \"Antique\" shops located on the same block - go to those. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 I have been here a couple times before but the last time I went I got incredibly rude service from someone named Kevin.  He also told me that wait time for a simple inspection would be under 1 hour and I told him great as I had somewhere to be.  They proceeded to take over 3 hours to complete the job.  I am never going back there.  They are a joke. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 This is the only negative review I have written, but this one has earned it. The flooring I chose looks good and the sub-contracted installer was great, BUT the owner of this business was EXTREMELY rude and aggressive, yelling at me his customer(!) in a most abusive way! I was so shocked by his crazy outburst I actually had to ask him to leave my home! I have since heard that he has a reputation for aggressive and unreasonable  behavior and the installer has also since refused to work for him. I have NEVER encountered a vendor like this before and it was particularly unpleasant in my own home. I hope he gets some medical treatment, but I advise you to take your business anywhere else if you don't want to risk an unwarranted, ugly scene in your home. \n",

Their portions are of course small for their price and mediocre for their taste. Pretty nice ambiance for a date.. but not a large party, you almost feel suffocated. \n",
      " \n",
      "I mean I've seen larger restaurants where the waiter can take and remember orders and still keep himself composed.. this one was just disappointing.

They could not be any more rude or unhappy. It really is a shame for the animals because it make you not want to adopt one from here. They are even really nasty to their volunteers who are giving their time and energy. It really is very sad all the way around. \n",

The bus boy tried to give me my bill back without my credit card, when I asked him for it back he tried to convince me that I had lost it.  When I returned and asked to see the receipt they had created a new one and forged my tip and signature.  The manager backed him up the whole time and was very rude.

      ">>> 1.0 My family has been going to Cold Springs Tavern for years and we love the atmosphere and the food. However, my friends and I booked the outdoor space for an evening graduation after-party, and we were extremely disappointed with the way the event planner Alexis handled the night. Over the course of the night, Alexis was rude and disorganized. She yelled and rolled her eyes at one of the people attending the event for accidentally spilling a drink, and could not keep track of the bill when it came time to pay. In addition, there were multiple hidden fees in the bill, such as a $10 plate fee on top of the $30 for each meal, and a $2 cake-cutting fee per person. None of these fees were discussed with us beforehand, and contributed to chaos and confusion at the end of the night. When Alexis couldn't resolve the bill, one of the members of our event stayed an extra hour and a half to figure it out. The space itself was beautiful and the food was delicious (although a bit overpriced for the portion size) but I would NOT recommend planning an event here- you will have to do most of the work yourself, and it gets very pricey. \n",

Ok. I told him i didnt want any, he said \"you shouldnt worry about the price you should just get what you want.\" Excuse me? I didnt come in here for you to tell me how to spend my money. He was also rude to his coworker. And to top it off the cash register crashed he said it would be 2 mins after about ten minutes it still wasnt working, at least i got a free sandwhich and cookie out of it. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 Didn't have a chance to actually eat here because we were kicked out of our table after being seated due to their clipboard system not being very effective! Waited about 25 min for a table outside, got seated by a cool dude, after about two minutes got confronted by John who said we needed to sign in, which we did. The first guy who sat us came around and let him he know he sat us, John didn't seem too happy and was very unprofessional with his co-worker. John left and came back and asked us where our name was on the clipboard, we showed him, he went on to explain that there was another party before us that was waiting to be seated.... how is that our fault? He didn't ask- he told us we need to leave our table and wait for the next one to come up, again unprofessional and rude. Left the place, called and spoke to manager Pete who gave a generic response. Hope this doesn't happen to anyone else! \n",

They made it in a small cup anywas, so I asked if they had larger ones and they said \" no that is the size cup we serve iced lattes in\" but I could clearly see they had larger cups which I pointed at and said \"if u don't mind can I have it in that cup? cuz I like to fill it up the rest of the way with water\" he said no and went on some rant about conservation and waste and plastic cups! PS I came for coffee not  a lecture!  needless to say I didn't get what I wanted. The way I see it they should try and concern themselves with conserving customers cuz there rude attitudes are a real turn off! I won't be back! Handlebar is better coffee and service by far! \n",

I even hosted a large birthday dinner there with about 13 people and they were very accommodating. I really like the food and I also think their kids menu is one of the best in town. I have to downgrade my rating based on my visit this week. I made reservations 3 weeks prior for the outside seating. The hostess said that was totally fine. Ok great, I show up there and they seat my party inside. The extremely rude man at the hostess station explained to me that they never guarantee outside seating with reservations, that's fine if it's true but don't you think all of the host staff should have the same knowledge? He had a horrible attitude which made things worse. I had planned on purchasing a gift card that night for a coworker and opted to purchase at Finneys instead purely because of how rude that person was and I didn't want to deal with getting a gift card from him. Lastly, our waitress was SO bad. She seemed like she was on another planet the whole time and also gave us the wrong bill. Bluewater Grill has very good food and the location is great, I think you all need to invest in better staff. \n",

      "The actual restaurant has usual food, but the sandwiches you order from outside. They put garlic butter on the bread and toast it on the grill for you.

The bar tenders were just rude and lazy. Both male and female bathrooms had three individuals coming out of there doing im not even sure what. The selection of alcohol is substandard compared to every other bar down state street. Management wouldn't even care about this one review but that's fine hopefully someone reads this and manages to salvage their night. Absolutely incredible how bad the bar tenders were plus how neglected the restrooms were. I get it, it's a bar none the less this is such a subpar bar compared to the rest of the ones on state street. If it weren't for the college students who didn't know any different Id say this bar would have been ran out of business a while ago. Btw what bar has no bar tenders behind the table because they're too busy talking to whoever is was outside the bar? \n",

      ">>> 1.0 I recently stayed at the Sandpiper Lodge and woke up in the morning to the sound of the power going out in our hotel room. The air conditioners all shut off and the sound machine that helps our baby sleep fell silent. We waited over an hour for someone to come notify us of the situation, before we went to find staff. The front staff, let us know that they were working on the power pole and power would be out all day. That's it, no apology for the situation, no recommendation for additional accommodations. Nothing. When I asked if this was a planned outage, he responded with he didn't plan it and that there would be no type of compensation since it was not the hotel's fault. I felt that this was nothing short of rude and this made me feel completely disappointed in the hotel and its staff and policy if this is how the guests are treated. When I pay over $250 a night for a hotel, I expect the basics to be available to us throughout the length of our stay, including but not limited to: the lights, hair dryer, air conditioning, mini fridge, tv, and outlets to charge our devices. Our only options were to get dressed in the pitch black or get dressed with the shades open which lead straight out to the parking lot. The fact that we didn't even receive an apology at the very least, only shows me that the hotel has no respect for its guests. We found out after the fact that the hotel had been notified in advance of the power outage. \n",

I've traveled places and I can get better seafood with better seating process and great to excellent customer service. This place is also not well kept.. disgusting front entrance!! \n",

I admit I was expecting the place to be less formal and therefore less expensive and would have a more comfortable atmosphere.\n",

However, as we walked out the same man and an older woman (the owners, I presume) confronted us (more like accosted us) and made some really snarky remarks about us not staying and just using the bathroom and how we were \"sneaky\".  I was shocked!  We've all worked/are working in the hospitality/restaurant/wine industry and have seen it all.  I have NEVER been treated this way.  I understand it looked like we just popped in to use the bathroom, but there are much better ways of addressing the situation - or just let it go!!!  A better approach: smile, say, \"Thanks for checking us out!  Hope you decide to give us a try sometime soon!\" - then grumble after we've left the building? \n",

With that said I was wearing sandles that have a thick wooden bottom and a strap on the back, basically a nice supportive pair of sandles not your every day flip flop. I was on the dancefloor dancing when i felt an extreme pain in my foot. When i looked down I noticed blood gushing out of my foot. I ran over to our booth to realized that a large piece of glass had pierced through my shoe and up into my foot. At this point i got the attention of the bouncers to help clean up the blood and my foot. The bouncers were extremely rude and declined to give me a free drink because in their eyes it was MY FAULT for stepping on the glass. They kept claiming i had no shoes on so they were not liable for it, when i did IN FACT have my shoes on the glass was just large and sharp enough to pierce through my shoe and into my foot. At this point i had had enough. I declined signing any waver because i thought how they handled the situation was extremely rude, ridiculous, and inconsiderate. All I wanted at that point was to get the hell out of that place. \n",

We RUSHED up the stairs--passing another staff member COMING DOWN along the way-- only to find the door at the top locked along with a sign which said it closed at 4:45. Got back down & asked man why he (not to mention the woman who probably locked the door & passed us on the stairs) didn't tell us that the viewing portion closed before the rest of the building.

Even sitting outside is not a better alternative unless you want to face (and smell) a carwash. Staff is rude. My suggestion is to go to the French Press on State street instead, or better yet, Peet's. Even though both French Press locations serve the same coffee (or so I was told), somehow it is prepared better and presented better at the State Street location. I would suggest that this location on Anacapa is a must-miss. \n",

One would expect to have something besides just having access to the roof of a hotel.   Maybe like some cookies, candies or something to nibble on, especially when paying $13 dollars a cocktail - but no...It was clear this party was about profit and from the looks of it, they lost their behinds.  Zoe was there, she was rude.  I can tell she is NOT a class act.  You could tell the other workers were displeased with her as they were punchy too.

      ">>> 1.0 The pictures are very deceptive. This is not a B&B and should not be listed as such. The price I paid for a four nite stay was not worth it. The Continental breakfast was something you would receive at a Motel 6 or Holiday Inn. More importantly,  the maintenance man, who reminded me of the movie Deliverance was soooo rude. He blocked a doorway with his grotesque physique out to the parking garage. He got up in my face and space and told me to go around. I was so Creeped out and appaulded by this subhuman creature. \n",

How is this place still open? Myself and others have been turned away for a various list of \"reasons\" that ranged from \"Dress Code\" (I'm an on point gay man. What their awful, rude bouncer meant to say was, \"you're gay and we don't want a reputation.\"), to \"We're not letting more folks in\" despite white patrons being let in while people I know waited in line. If you really are desperate to go here, just go home, put an alt-right rally on blast, and disrespect your reflection in the mirror.

I asked if there were flavored tea. A different worker replied this isn't Starbucks. She was so rude and it was unnecessary it was a simple yes or no question.

I forgot my certificate at home so I told them when I got there I asked if I could go get it after they finished. They said no very rude, you have to pay cash.  They acted like I was making it up.  I didn't want to go back home and wasn't sure if I left it my car or what so I just stayed and got a pedicure.  The woman who did it could barely speak English so there was really no conversation during my service. I was surprised she didn't put gloves on! I wasn't looking for a minute but I heard her clip my first toenail.  It was my big toe and I had just trimmed them the night before.  This was my first pedicure so I didn't know what to expect.  She cut it way too short.  Now I know to tell them not to cut but to file my toenails.  The water was too hot so I asked her to make it cooler.  She went through the whole procedure and it was okay.  After she polished my toenails, she put my flip flops on while my toes were still very wet.  She messed up the polish on one toe so she had to redo it with my flip flops on.  I went over to the nail dryer and she came and showed me my bill.  It was $25 so I gave her my debit card.  When she came back the receipt said $26 which she said included tax I think.  She pointed to the tip line and I said I'd give her cash for that.  Overall I rate her 2 out of 5 stars.  When I got home and really looker at her work, one of my big toenails was shorter than the other and she left nail polish and top coat stains on the base of my toenails.  It wasn't a lot but it was enough to notice.  They're supposed to be professionals.  I wish I brought my certificate then it wouldn't be anything out of my pocket.  Now I have to go back to use it.  If they have another location, I'll go there instead.  I don't recommend this salon.  They weren't very friendly or professional. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 This was such a horrible piercing experience. I had my nose pierced in my hometown over three months prior to coming into Golden Eagle. I came in because I'd read good reviews, but my experience was completely opposite of what they'd suggested. I only came to buy a new stud (from the piercer, Johnny). He asked me if I wanted it in a \"corkscrew\" or \"L\" shape. I wasn't sure what the difference was so I asked, to which he responded by rolling his eyes. He grabbed a piece of paper and quickly drew the shapes. I asked which he would recommend. He huffed and rolled his eyes again replying the \"L\" shape. He put in the stud quickly, and when I told him it did not feel comfortable he said that my nose just \"had to get used to it.\" I payed and left. For the next week every time I woke up or even sneezed the stud would come part of the way out. A keloid developed so I returned to ask what to do about it (I had been doing sea salt soaks but I asked what to do in addition to those). Johnny quickly dismissed me saying I should continue with the soaks (and did not even offer the pre-packaged salt I later learned they give out). I did the soaks for about a month before finally removing the stud myself and leaving only the unsightly keloid. I returned to see what they could do. The piercer, Josh, was there and looked wide eyed when he saw the keloid. He gave me the salt they use and told me he would repierce it for free when it healed. I returned today. Josh had seemed much more professional than Johnny, so I was happy to see him. For some unknown reason he was SO rude and even went to the extent to comment on that \"I wore too much makeup\" and I \"need to sit up more\" since I'm \"short.\" I fortunately left my i.d., giving myself great excuse to leave. A friend had come with me and was as upset as I was because of the way he had been talking to me. Every question I asked he seemed so cocky and condescending. I feel like they have so many clients that they feel they can treat people as unprofessional as they'd like. Every time I left that place I was on the verge of tears because of how unprofessional and rude they'd been. I ended up going to the piercer at Precious Slut. I told the piercer there that I had just come from a piercer that had been a complete asshole to me. She said \"Golden Eagle?\" I was suprised she knew exactly where I was talking about, but she said she gets people who come into there all the time and vent to her about what jerks the piercers at Golden Eagle are. I'm astounded there aren't more reviews like mine on these guys. Worst piercing experience of my life. \n",

We seemed to have totally ruined her day by asking for a table for two. She proceeded to keep us waiting and basically ignored us even though the place half full. The floor of this restaurant was filthy, and as for the toilets, let's not go there. Leaves a lot to be desired in terms of rude staff and sushi chefs who all seem miserable. If your looking for a relaxed and enjoyable dining experience go anywhere but here! \n",

When I got my iced chai it was just milk with some chai powder. I could've made something better at my house. I ended up throwing it away after a few sips because it was so bad. Don't go here unless you want bad service and bad drinks. \n",

After wine tasting and hanging out on State Street for a little bit, the power came back on in many places, except for the hotel we were originally going to stay at (Avania Inn).  The lady at the front desk there was super rude and only wanted to give us half of our money back after we said we would find another hotel with power (and all we had done was throw our things into the room before wine tasting -- we hadn't even opened the soap).  She ended up refunding us, and we headed out to find a place...\n",

At best, I would describe it as pretentious and unprofessional as they complained about the customers who made their paycheck. Any request made was deemed a hassle even when it benefited them. We ordered multiple flights and received only half of our order. Upon request for the rest of it they stated they were low on wine glasses. However we could see a full wall of wine glasses and flutes. The server reluctantly completed our order and was snobby, rude and aloof. By the way, how long does it take to clean up dog piss?! We notified them that a dog peed on their floor and they just let it sit there for 5 min while they figured out who should clean it. Anyone could have slipped and fell. Although I'm not sure they would care. They ended our experience by asking, \"Can we cash you out?\".  They followed this with,\"what did you order again?\" Unbelievable. We went next door to Drake, and had a great time! We will never never be back, stay away from Corks. \n",

I asked to talk to the manager and Kevin ran the extra mile to make me happy: Kevin drove me to an appointment I had of life threatening nature.

I called and called - back to the stupid message machine. Then they text \"we're checking our guests out.\" They said they had ONE Queen and ONE King available. I text back \"I would like to book the Queen.\" Suddenly some robot reply saying they're only available between 7am and 9pm (um - it was 11:15am). I quickly got online on my desktop computer to book that room and something odd happened and said it coudnt do it. Frustrated I called again and left voicemail. They never called.

I texted back telling them that I had called and called yesterday and texted I wanted that room and what did they respond with? That robot that says they're available form this time to that time.

Absolutely ridiculous considering the price of one açaí bowl ($9 or more for a SMALL). The bowls are subpar and not worth the wait, considering I find a huge chunk of frozen fruit in the mix almost every time I visit. The employees are slow and definitely couldn't give less of a shit when you get your bowl, and they're always chit chatting instead of actually being helpful. If you want a bowl, it will be on their time and it probably won't be very good.

Johnny was the only piercer up there and he had someone in front of us. We waited for him to be done, then he showed us the jewelry we could purchase, I have a lip piercing already and was curious to see if it was the same jewelry, I went to turn the piece of plastic that has all the jewelry on it around, and was screamed at for doing so, saying I could be charged thousands of dollars for touching the jewelry. He was rude, he yelled at me because I laid on the table when he only asked me to sit. Charged us 70 dollars each for the piercings because we got \"top of the line\" jewelry. He was very brief with after-care, really acted like he didnt want to be there. But the straw that broke the camels back is now, 8 months later, my roommate and I are both experiencing very bad hypertrophic scarring on our piercings! which I am finding out could be due to jewelry quaility or skin slippage during the procedure. I thought about going back and complaining, but I'd rather go elsewhere then have to deal with that asshole again!  My friend recommended me to them but personally, I would never recommend them to someone who wants a quality piercing. I have been to many tattoo/piercing shops throughout southern california and this was by far my worst experience! \n",

      ">>> 1.0 As a French person i can tell that the quality of the wine is below average. It seemed to be that the girl who was helping us out knows nothing about wines. We were not very satisfied with the quality of service so left small tip and the girl was rude to us after not getting decent tips \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 2.0 Dishonest business conduct. Owner knows what she's doing when deceiving customers with a Menu that reads one price but when the bill comes they slide in the extra bucks. This happens with quite a few essential dinner orders, like the pad thai, which is listed exactly as \"Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai\" for $9.99, You order it. The bill comes charging $12.99 for it, because it has shrimp and chicken and this is extra!! Same with the curry dishes, etc. You will always get overcharged. Most won't even notice it. \n",
      "The portions are small. You order an appetizer for 5 people and it brings a tiny dish with sauce that is only good for one person. When you call waiter for more sauce they will bring it, but then the bill will later reflect a buck extra for that tiny amount of extra sauce that wasn't enough either! It is a shame that the ownership is such a money monger and we can't believe they are still getting away with this. Many locals, including ourselves, have confronted the owner directly about this issue to have her only say that she will change the menu with correct pricing. She told us this during spring last year, but our friends dined there recently and had the exact same menu and billing problem. \n",
      "To top it up, the staff is rude and short-sided. They come across as nice at first, but don't ask them for anything or question anything. The service is very lacking. The food is not bad in general. Pad Thai tastes like the rusty pan, but they can make good strong sauces. Our noodles are always very sticky and gummy as if they were sitting in water for a while, but the sauces are very good. Again, it's a shame we have a local business that takes many of us as fools and disrespects the community blatantly. \n",
      "Until they decide to do better we would not encourage anyone to dine there. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 My friend came by today to purchase a bar for her ear. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by an extremely rude guy who did nothing but rip his narcissistic attitude onto her \"weird\" ear length and the \"incompetence\" of the place where she got her ear pierced. From repeatedly cutting her off to speaking to her in a loud tone of voice, instead of feeling like a valued customer bringing her money and her time to this establishment, she instead felt like a nuisance. Horrible service! If you're looking for a shop that's not going to greet you like they're doing YOU a favor, take your money and time elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 3.0 The bread is good, but the service is horrible. I've had several experiences of bad service, especially from the male cashier, who seems to be bothered by attending to customers. \n",
      "On one occasion I was trying to juggle a tray full of bread and my baby, and I sat the baby down on the counter to adjust and not have an accident, I was very rudely told to get my kid off the counter. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 Seriously wish I could leave ZERO stars. The customer service here is TERRIBLE! There was an extremely rude blonde girl working the register around 10:30 pm tonight and she had the worst attitude. She made comments such as \"well, I'm busy\" and \"it's not my problem\". Um, if you don't like your job find a new one! On top of their terrible \"customer service\" their food is just blah. Save your money and go elsewhere, this place doesn't deserve to be in business! Please pack up your rude delusional employees (you work at a pizza parlor honey) and your mediocre food and leave Santa Barbara. \n",

      ">>> 1.0 After driving through the dark hills and then arriving to live music and people outside, my girlfriend and I were excited to dine here for our date, but we were greeted with one of the rudest and indifferent waitresses I've ever had the displeasure of serving us. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't say this if I truly saw some merit in her service, being a former server myself, I think I am forgiving to the things servers have to put up with, but we hadn't even started and I felt like she just wanted to go home. \n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't welcome us at all and callously asked if we had reservation-- we said \"no,\" and even though only two tables were taken she hesitated. I was worried and I really wanted to eat here because of all I had heard and it was a special night for my girlfriend and me and I felt the waitress's reluctance very clearly. \n",

As quoted from one of my favorite Japanese dramas, \"Bad service will make the greatest food taste horrible.\" And that bad first taste lingered throughout our mediocre meal. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 Please don't rent from these awful people. They have a scam going where they demand two months security for whatever reason and you're lucky if you get half back no matter what the circumstances. Most of the staff is extremely rude acting like you're bothering them by trying to do business. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 It was supposed to be my Birthday dinner, but, instead, we were met with rudeness. We were seated and then moments later told that they had a reservation for a party of 7 at the table they just sat us at (the restaurant was filled with customers who have been there already). We were told that we need to eat within an hour so they can seat the other people.  How rude! To give your customers a time limit to eat so they can fill it with more.  Needless to say we left & ate at a more bigger & more pleasant restaurant just 1 block down, also Thai, called Galanga.  This place was excellent, friendly, and attentive.  Zen Yai deserves a 0 rating, but , since I cannot post without giving something, they get an undeserved rating of 1. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 I normally love this place for dinner but this Sunday 5/5 I had the worst experience and it wasn't because of the food. It was the manager Manny. I ordered 2 rolls over the phone and I knew they were busy but they guaranteed me a 20 minute wait. I was driving from Ventura to Paso Robles so I said it would be fine since I would rest for a bit while I waited. When I went in there they told me it would be another 15 minutes and I could clearly see it was busy so I understood completely. Now...15 minutes later I return and he tells me it will be another 15 minutes. By this point I was irritated because I still had a 2 hour drive and it was 8pm now. So I asked him if I could have my money back instead because it was getting late and how I wish he would have not gave me a time frame because it was not accurate whatsoever....maybe I came off rude but I was just frustrated. Manny went off to saying how he wouldn't give me my money back because the roll was already in the oven, and if I wanted I could speak to the chef making it. Then he said he wasn't a mind reader to know what the customers at the tables were going to order and therefore it was impossible to give me an exact time. I did not reply to him...and when I finally received my food I asked him for a small side of sriracha which to he replied \"only if you have a dollar\". I just smiled and walked out. For such a Busy and delicious place, I'm shocked at the poor management they have. Customer service is definitely not Manny's priority, he's just there for a paycheck. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 5.0 I had a fabulous time on this tour. It was my husbands and I first time going on a tour.we had lisa as our sommelier who was fantastic. I definetely gained a great amount of knowledge and enjoyed the beautiful winerys that we went to. Lisa was friendly and so were the staff from the winerys we went to. They werent snobby or rude, they were very welcoming and made my trip very pleasant. Im definetely booking another trip during the harvest season to taste the grapes. A huge thank you to lisa and the rest of the staff there. \n",

      "\n",
      "We came in early for a late lunch/early dinner and service wasn't friendly.  Older hostess seemed a little annoyed seating us, even though we had called ahead.  The waitress was a bit rude and the hibachi chef wasn't very friendly and a didn't really make us feel like he wanted to be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think hibachi grills are really about the chef and interacting, we (my husband and I) both discussed after \n",

      "\n",
      "This place has a great location in a busy area but I'd recommend going a little out of your way to find another one.  Maybe we just got unlucky and it's typically better then this?  Who knows but I'll check out a different place when in SB again. \n",
      "\n",

      ">>> 1.0 Came here from out of town and saw this place on yelp.. I got a rose flight and a glass of wine.. Boyfriend got a flight.. His parents got a glass of wine and a glass of beer.. And after I sat down and finished my last drink.. I thought oh snap I forgot to check in on yelp!!  So after I check in and proceed to the bar.. Another girl was at the bar and the waitress asks \"do you need help?\" I say \"you can help her\" other girl says \"no it's ok go for it\" waitress looks at me and I show her my check in and she says in a condescending voice \"oh you just want free alcohol\" and turns to the other girl and says \"how can I help you..\" And even after the other girl ordered I can tell she was taking her sweet time so she didn't have to help me.. \n",

There are better places in the area that treat you better and deserve my patronage.. The waitress was way too rude and in my opinion I felt discriminated against..  My advice.. Be careful about the yelp check in/free pour.. You'll end up getting terrible service.. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>> 1.0 Food is OK but the service is terrible. Our waitress was rude and inpatient! She seemed fine with other table's guests though so I guessed it might be the perfume I was wearing. Won't go again and we don't recommend this restaurant to anyone either. \n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have sentences, the next step is to split the line into words, so we can query the texts for occurrences of certain words. The problem of determining what the words are is called word segmentation or word tokenization (creating individual word tokens out of a string). \n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly the challenge is, depends on the language. First, there is ostensibly the problem of what a word is. Occurring between two spaces is a pretty decent criterium for many European languages. We will consider another frequent type of challenge, that of finding word boundaries without spaces or lower numbers of spaces (like Chinese), or with too many spaces (like Vietnamese).\n",

    "### Punctuation stripping\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it's quite accurate, we do find issues: are compounds like _fan zone_ a single word or two (cf. _friendzone_)? Or phrasal verbs like _hang up_ (cf. the Dutch cognate _ophangen_, which is written without a space in the infinitive, but separately when the verb but not the particle 'moves' away from its base position in the indicative (_ik hang het op_ -- 'I hang it up'). \n",
    "\n",
    "In computational linguistics, there are two further issues which has been central to research into word segmentation, as they are more relevant for practical purposes \n",
    "* the **co-occurrence of punctuation** with words (_history._ at the end of the second sentence occurs between spaces, but we would ideally have that token be recognized as \"the same\" as _history_ elsewhere)\n",
    "* the presence of **clitic and compound forms** (in languages like English and French written with apostrophes; _Mark's_,_I've_, but in other languages hyphenated, or written with a capital (like isiZulu) and hyphenated forms (like _six-time_ in the Lowry text)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the two in turn. First, dealing with 'attached' punctuation means that we want to strip them of the left and right edge of a space-bound substring of the text, and treat them as their own tokens. The following function does just that. Read the code and see if you follow. (This is another kind of prompt in these notebooks -- being able to read code and understand it, is a very useful skill as a computational linguist. We can talk about aspects of the code you didn't understand during tutorials)."

Then set $i$ to be the end of the last-found word and repeat. This is the approach at the heart of this paper, for instance: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C96-1035.pdf.\n",
